He also believes that masculinity as a concept is inherently toxic (I'll get into the details below, he did an interview where he explains why)In case you didn't know, he describes himself as a radical feminist. He did an interview with Vice.com where he goes into more detail on his views on this topic, but I think I can summarize them pretty well in this post. [Here's his full interview with Vice if you to know his view on this issue in greater detail](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://www.vice.com/amp/en_ca/article/zmk3ej/all-masculinity-is-toxic&ved=2ahUKEwjbmcu_5fnoAhXDTN8KHQ12B80QFjAAegQIBBAB&usg=AOvVaw1cB20RqEciXqCreKtu6mEY&ampcf=1). I recommend reading it.\n\nBasically his argument is that traits and qualities associated with masculinity or femininity are just human qualities that any individual might have, man or woman. Men can be shy, quiet, emphatic, etc. and women can be violent, aggressive, prideful, etc. John think's it's unfair that some of these qualities are associated heavily with one gender or the other, and that qualities such as empathy and kindness are universal human qualities that should not be genderized or viewed as feminine. Likewise, women can be violent too, and as such violence should not be viewed as solely masculine. All these traits should just be viewed as human traits. I pretty much agree with this point of view.\n\nHowever, he argues that the main thing that distinguishes masculinity and femininity (as social concepts/ideas/roles) is that masculinity promotes violence and aggression, while femininity does not. As such, he argues that masculinity as a social concept is inherently toxic, because masculinity promotes harmful behaviors that femininity doesn't promote. Even though he believes that toxic behaviors like violence and aggression are not inherent qualities of men or women, he believes that that traits and behaviors promoted by masculinity are generally more toxic than those promoted by femininity. Still, he thinks masculinity and femininity as concepts should be done away with.\n\nThoughts? I recommend reading the interview with Vice.",

He's not saying that every trait seen as masculine is toxic, but rather that the need to feel secure in a constructed male identity leads to devaluation of women, and that traits should be evaluated by the standard of what makes a good person rather than what makes a good man or woman.\n\nEdit: I do describe myself as a masculine person, but that has nothing to do with seeing myself as male (I'm a cis woman). It's more a description of how people perceive me based on my appearance and mannerisms.

Even if the vegan doesn't care what you eat, you might feel like their actions present an idea that, if true, could mean that you have been doing something bad for most of your life: eating meat is bad. This makes you feel guilty and judged so you reject the idea and mock the vegan. \n\nThis is explained much better in Innuendo Studio's [video](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=ExEHuNrC8yU&list=PLJA_jUddXvY62dhVThbeegLPpvQlR4CjF&index=3&t=0s) but that's the general idea.

The friend is a feminist, if that makes a difference. Her choice of words took me aback a little because 'bitchy' isn't used often among the people with whom I hang out. I don't use it myself, but due to a general aversion to profanity or otherwise harsh language rather than any concerns about sexism. Upon reflection, though, I thought that 'bitchy' actually bothered me a bit rather than just surprising me. \n\n*Is* it sexist? 'Bitchy' only ever seems to be directed at either women or people perceived to be acting in a feminine or effeminate manner. Relatedly, the insult 'dick' (which I also don't use, but again not for sexism-related reasons) is pretty much never applied to women. However, something being statistically associated with only one gender doesn't mean it's necessarily sexist. \n\nIt's not like I'd tell my friend she should stop using the term, but I am curious about feminists' views on gender-related insults such as this. Are they sexist? Or does nobody really care? It's quite possible I only took note of it due to great boredom rather than any actual hint of sexism.",

Incels and some better men down on their luck, or guys who dont know better make the comment of \"Girls only like jerks\".  \n\nNow I've thought about this and probably at one point agreed with it without thinking too much.  It's a thing in popular media and sometimes guys who seem like pricks have girlfriends and every wife beater has to have gotten a wife at some point (or else it's just assault).  Doesnt help that I watched a video by (Screamo?  Streamo?  Some variation of that I think it had an exclamation point, he interviewed the republican gun lobbyist who survived a school shooting) that literally had women calling him a jerk and a fuck boy but still saying they'd fuck him (I pulled one bit of salvageable advice out of that but that's another question)\n\nBut I've realized a few things (please poke holes if you can)\n\nA) that implies monolithism (which not being that makes it really hard to discuss issues).  I've met some girls who would absolutely not tolerate dickishness\n\nB)  Could be other features.  Most dicks are to some degree at least confident or driven so those are good qualities\n\nC) most guys that say this aren't really guys I'd like to hang out with or classify as nice\n\nBut perhaps more importantly, \n\nD) guys do it too.\n\n\nThere is this thing that I think is just as prevalent in media about a dude defrosting an ice queen for lack of a better word (is that term sexist?  I think it is but languages fails me as I cannot think of a suitable replacement for the platonic ideal).\n\n\nThe women would undoubtedly be a jerk (why does that sound masculine?), or at the very least cold and unemotional.  Through out the movie (using a fictional example here) the hero would defrost her via kindness, witticism or heroism.  And they'd get together.  Now she doesn't necessarily have to be mean but definitely more business and aloof.  Or turning it\n\nIn real life I think its definitely a fantasy of most men for the same reasons above.  I know I personally have had crushes on girls who were not the kindest in their interactions with people (or at the very least attraction whether they were just genuinely attractive and my brain ignored the other parts or there \"badness\" made them more attractive).  \n\n\n\nPoint is that it's a phenomena and something I have personally experienced so I guess \"Guys like bad girls?\".  Not monolithic but it is to my knowledge a thing?\n\n\nSo why is it not generally levied in reverse?  Am I way off on my assumption and this is more a me thing?  Is it patriarchy?  Doe femcels not use this language?  Does if have to do with framing like the most attractive women is the evil one or they are made more attractive through framing?\n\nPlease correct me if I'm wrong.",

                    "body": "What I believe to be going on here is you have noticed how the media grabs the attention of people, largely young and immature that dont have developed emotions, portray romantic situations. When we are young and the person we like has a boyfriend or girlfriend, we often think of the other as a bad person so we arent guilty for wanting someone that is committed/involved/seeing to someone else, especially when we arent getting any attention. When media targets this audience, they portray this situation to be true, affirming the viewers feeling of their interests partner as a dick. We love feeling right. While this is largely portrayed as a young man having interest in a girl whos ex or partner is a dick (Scott pilgrim vs the world for example), it is portrayed both ways. Often, the love interest male is dating a pretty girl that isnt right for him (Im looking at you Taylor swift in you belong with me). Essentially, it is hoping that the audience watches this to affirm their feelings, so they consume the rest of the medium (movie, album, etc). It reflects a me not we mentality when it comes to love. The subject in both gendered roles is only thinking about what they want, disregarding the other person of interests choice in their actual partner. I studied what love actually is using a lot of philosophical backing, and I can say with confidence this is more possession than it is love, which is what we feel in our high school days and thats fine. Many young people confuse the two, as long as our life experience enable us to move on and exist with self love and eventual outward love. In short, its a product of immaturity more than sexism, but sexism can definitely spin this situation into something else when it comes to relationships. All that being said, people dont always choose people that are good for them. No one is perfect theres a very interesting psychological theory that analyses the people we find appealing romantically, and how it relates to our past. People are likely to date those that give us familiar types of suffering as opposed to those that show us new types. For example, if your parents always yelled at you and \nYou never got over it, you would date someone that yelled to communicate adversity. Same thing with passive aggression, violence, and communication. We choose the familiar, unless we actively take steps to avoid it. And when someone we want to date chooses someone who gives them the suffering they are used to, it justifies the feelings I previously discussed EVEN MORE. (Heres a really cool video on the suffering bit, its far from hard science but is a really interesting theory on relationship dynamics as it relates to developmental psychology: https://youtu.be/Hvysy11716g). To summarize, love triangles are common and no one thinks wow my love interest didnt choose me, but thats fine! Until they love themselves.\n\nEdit: had to change the Taylor swift song to the one I was thinking of, and added the part about relationship dynamics",

What do you think happens to the husbands whose wives arranged their social calendar for the last 30 years?\n\nToxic masculinity dissuades boys from working with their friends to process emotions. Whereas women and girls *define* friendships by how vulnerable they can be with each other. \n\nSo, men grow up thinking a romantic relationship is the space where you can be open about your emotions. Oftentimes they dump all their lives emotional baggage on their partner, which is bad for the female partner who expects to *share* this work. But worse, how many years can a man go without that space where he can process how hes dealing with life stress? \n\nIf a man never learns the tools to process everyday emotions, and never had a friendship where they felt open doing so, I have no doubt they can turn bitter and violently lash out at women.",

            "body": "Do you think breasts are inherently sexual?Sorry if this sounds a bit scattered, I'm just writing a stream-of-consciousness about my thoughts on this right now. This question has been haunting me for many years. I remember this one time I was at the beach when I was young and I was watching the boys around me wearing just their swim trunks and how free it must feel not to have to wear a top, and I felt this sort of painful longing. I felt sad that girls just couldn't do that, because boobs are \"inappropriate\".\n\nNow that I'm older, I have many more thoughts about this. I still feel the painful longing I felt when I was younger whenever I see men just being allowed to have their shirts off and not have to cover their nipples. And I just wonder, why is it that boobs are seen to be nearly as sexual, if not *just* as sexual, as genitalia? There is really no difference between male nipples and female nipples except for the female breast's function to breastfeed, which requires more fatty tissue.\n\nMy theory on this is that women's bodies are just so objectified and oversexualized in every way that even body parts that seem biologically and inherently sexual really *aren't*. Rather, everyone in (at least western) societies have become socialized to cater to the male gaze, which views women through a lens that hyper-sexualizes women for male benefits. I do not think that female breasts are inherently sexual; rather, our response to viewing breasts in a purely sexual way is a result of being trained over and over and over that breasts are for men's sexual viewing pleasure. We have sexualized women's breasts so much that women cannot even breastfeed their children in public, a normal biological need, without being hyper-sexualized and condemned.\n\nTheoretically, I think it is possible for women's breasts to be seen as just as nonsexual as men's are. It will take many, many years of deconstructing the male gaze and removing men from the position of the \"default\" human being (thereby removing marginalization), but I think it can happen. For the most part, I believe we have a choice of which body parts we choose to sexualize or not sexualize (besides *maybe* genitalia). For instance, biologically, cis straight women overwhelmingly prefer men with larger shoulder to hip ratios, but you do not see men's shoulders being covered up and hypersexualized. I do not think that is because men's shoulders are actually \"less sexy\" than women's breasts; rather, I believe it is because most societies have been designed for men, with men being the \"viewers\" and women being the ones who are viewed. And so, men's preferences and decisions on what is \"sexy\" or not have taken precedence and are thought of as being universal, while women's desires and what body parts they view as sexy on men are mostly silenced or not recognized to be as sexy as any body part women possess, because women are, as we have been trained, inherently sexual, while men are not.\n\nIn general, sexualizing women's nipples while not sexualizing men's nipples creates an imbalance where women are taught to be inherently ashamed of the body they possess because it is automatically \"sexual\", while men are taught that their body is the normal, default body that is allowed to view women as objects for their sexual viewing pleasure.\n\nWhoops, this was a lot longer than I meant it to be. But I'm curious, what are your thoughts on this?\n\n**TLDR:** I believe women's breasts are over-sexualized because we have been socialized to view women through a male gaze which believes women's bodies to be inherently sexual. This, in turn, sexualizes body parts that are not actually sexual. I think it is theoretically possible to desexualize women's breasts in time, when men are no longer deemed to be the \"default\" human and society is not designed solely for men's benefits and desires.\n\n**Edit:** I also want to add that I am bisexual and nonbinary (AFAB). While I find women's boobs to be sexually attractive, I do not think of boobs *only* in that way and I do not think of women as being inherently sexual objects because of their bodies. I would have no problem living in a world where women can walk around with their tops off, because boobs are beautiful in ways that are more than just sexually, and so are women as a whole. I think boobs are a body part like any other, and they definitely can be sexy, but they are not aggressively inherently sexual and inappropriate like we have been ingrained with. Society has an undeniable problem with looking at women as parts rather than as people.",

I've barely found articles discussing those topics in depth, let alone feminist ones.\n\nFeel free to ask for clarification if needed.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: A question's been asked as to how one distinguishes robosexuality from objectophilia.\n\nIt's cerainly a good question, so it's not gonna be that easy to answer.\n\nI can't speak for all robosexuals, but in the robosexual community I frequent the most, they generally enjoy the reveal of a human actually being a robot. Think of Terminator-like reveals where there is damage to the skin, showing that the person you thought you knew actually just a near-perfect replica of a human, designed to either blend in with or serve humanity.\n\nI've also heard the claims that a big part of robosexuality is objectification, specifically of women. While there's a sub-group in the robosexual community that enjoys the idea of being turned into a machine designed for sexual contact., consent plays a big part for most of these types of robosexuals. They want to be turned into a machine. (There's also a sub-group that enjoys forceful conversion of people into robots; I personally don't enjoy that, but who am I to kink-shame.)\n\n**A big part for many robosexuals isn't the objectification of the feminine/masculine, it's the feminization/masculinization of objects.

And the chance of them being viable isnt even super high. \n\nThis got me thinking. \n\nFreezing storing sperm is easy well researched and often has a high success rate.\n\nIt not the case for females and maybe the reason is actually the process.   \n\nIt can take up too two weeks, you can be unable to do normal activity for up to a week after wards and that is all with no complications. \n\nMy question was knowing that the amount of research put into freezing eggs is rather low compared to the research into freezing sperm [i mean compare the process and just how hard getting samples would be.  With eggs being so much harder to obtain less people donate to science plus you get much less at once per person] should instead of focusing on using the current method, should more research money be spent on a safer way to induce ovulation and for removal instead of focusing so much on raising the egg survival rate? \n\nEdit: sorry if this is a confusing mess I am not the best at writing out what I am thinking.\n\nThe question is in short: due to the risky nature of the current process to indue ovulation for freezing eggs, would it make more sense to spend the research money on a safer way to induce ovulation instead of just on how to raise the success/survival rate of frozen eggs since a safer [and hopefully much cheaper] process would make it more accessible to more woman.

He said that he'd \"better become a feminist\" then. I know the meaning can be unique for certain people, but these last few months in quarantine have revealed to me that his political views are really different from mine. After making him dinner (again), we got into a heated argument on the gender wage gap. He doesn't get that (despite being illegal), female counterparts are paid (on average, counterparts meaning those colleagues in identical roles) less than their male counterparts. And now I am starting to doubt myself...\n\nYes, women have historically taken on lesser-paying professional roles, which is what my partner was arguing. I get that. But from what I've learned, it goes beyond that. If anyone could help me to find the evidence to support this, that would be much appreciated (info pertaining to wage gap between male/female employee counterparts, and yes I am aware of the difference that negotiating salary makes during initial hire and re-evaluating periods).

Yet, if your partner is into statistics, and thinks that only the most comprehensive and up-to-date will do:\n\n[https://www.payscale.com/data/gender-pay-gap](https://www.payscale.com/data/gender-pay-gap)  \n\"The controlled gender pay gap, which controls for job title, years of experience, industry, location and other compensable factors, has also decreased, but only by $0.01 since 2015. Women in the controlled group make $0.98 for every $1 a man makes.\n\nNew to the gender pay gap report for 2020 is analysis on the impact of lost wages on lifetime earnings. By calculating presumptive raises given over a 40-year career, we find that women in the uncontrolled group stand to lose $900,000 on average over a lifetime. Lost earnings narrow to $80,000 for the controlled group, but this is still significant, especially if you consider how lost earnings due to the gender pay gap would grow with compound interest if invested each year for 40 years.\"\n\nAlso, as a man who's come a long way from where I once was - if you don't think that the housework is being shared equally but he does, 98 times out of 100 you're right.  I was very good at confusing myself about the relative value of the work I was doing for the household, and advocating for my cockamamie logic.

(\"the ball gets heavier, and if you don't push harder, then the acceleration will decrease.\")\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBy doing this you can slowly build an understanding of physics. Every time you see/hear something you don't understand, test your intuition. If you find that the intuition is wrong, do the math and adjust your intuition accordingly. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is the most fun part of physics, so it's worth the effort! :)",

I thought it gave a good introduction to various concepts without just reciting a bunch of formulas.  Have you learned any calculus?  I found I understood some things better when I looked at back after learning calculus.  Beginner physics courses often bypass needing calculus by just giving derived or integrated equations that apply in particular simplified situations, while some get a better understanding by knowing how the given equations were derived.  \n\n\nSome people also do better when they start thinking about how those concepts apply in day to day life, and are able to get some sense of scale.  This is particularly an issue in America where you might be using USC in day to day life but SI in the classroom.  Mathematically, I can work out that a 10 kg block with an applied force of 100 N should have an acceleration of 10 ms^(-2).  Then think about something you can relate that to, 10 ms^(-2) is about how fast a dense object will fall, 10 KG is a small/medium size dog, or maybe a bag of onions sold at the grocery store, 100 N is about the weight of that dog or onions.  Highway speeds are around 28 m/s, residential areas might have a speed limit of 11 m/s, a typical walking pace is around 1.4 m/s.  Then if you get a question involving a trolley that has a speed of 2 m/s and applied force of 700 N, you can think of that 700 N being about as hard as you would be able to push something and the 2 m/s as a brisk walk to get an intuitive idea what the result should be before you put pencil to paper.  This also helps as a kind of check in that if you make a mistake in your calculation and get a result of something like the trolley weighing 2000 Kg you might notice it doesnt fit with your intuition from above.  \n\nThen again, sometimes it comes naturally over time as you start recognizing patterns in the questions, or you start getting more complex questions and have to apply those formulas in more complex ways.  Sometimes I found my skills grow when I would forget a particular formula while doing a test and work it out from more fundamental ones.  For example, I might not have always remembered the quadratic formula but I remembered enough from reading how it was derived to apply the same process to a test question.",

Abuse is an awful crime and we must take a more fair approach when deciding how we offer resources to victims.This is not to downplay any abuse suffered by women. And there are myriad platforms this is discussed in. My personal take is not to gender this issue and to deal with violence in general (yes we accept there are gender differences, in this case actually a lot so we act differently AS APPROPRIATE and ONLY WHERE NEEDED but we tackle the issue AS A WHOLE from the outset, using gendered laws and terms only when there is a good reason). However, this is not a commonly held view. For some dare I say almost all feminists, this is a gendered issue and the 1 in 4 men are not of concern as we should be focusing only on women. **This is not a \"feeling\" or a sentiment that you can deny by simply saying \"i don't so its not true, feminists do support men\"** \\- it is a cold hard fact, 2 mens shelters compared to 2000 for women as a result of where they have focused their attention in reality, biased policies and campaigns only focusing on women; multiple specific gendered domestic violence acts and laws yet always and exclsively for women alone.\n\nThe soloution: either feminists need to take this issue about men seriously in terms of trying to solve it with cold hard ACTUAL change/ lobbying/ campagning/ funding/ (not just \"yeah men can be victims too we care\") OR they need to allow MRA's to approach the issue without the constanst blocking/ banning/ no platforming MRAs who do receive. Even the sheer outrage when we mention statistics.  ***Legendary feminist ERIN PIZZEY opened the first battered shelter for women in the world. When she attempted to do so for men, many years later she received death threats and rape threats by other feminists. Domestic violence, was raised in the mens conference at the university of Cambridge. This event was savagely no platformed/ protested and by (some) feminists and they even played bells to stop the speakers from being heard.***\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. Other points, is time to remove uncessary gendered laws in many countries and states such as \"male assualts female\" which is a specific offence in some US states and commonwealth countries. Entirely uncessary, as it is covered under normal gender neutral law, and it makes no sesne why there should not be a \"female assualts male\" law or female assualts child and so on.\n2. In countries such as Australia there are no mandatory courses abusers who are women who are domestic abusers on avoidin violence, yet there are for men against women. This is one of countless over sights and gendered centric approaches, that currently taget one gender only.\n3. Either gender neutral violence acts (that of course leave room for even significantly different approaches to the genders, as it is very different) or specific acts that cover mens abuse, as there will be differences.\n4. The law needs rapidly gender neutralisisng and services refocused so we avoid regular occurences were male victims who call the police are being arrested or leaving the home!

Aren't such words also likely to be internalized harmfuly by young boys the way \"mankind\" is going to be internalized harmfuly by young girls?\n\nOf course all of it is neglecting the fact that the \"man\" in mankind was the term representing a human being, and has to do with the hand (\"main\" in French, same root as manual) at the time where male humans were referenced as \"wereman\" (like it is still in werewolf) and female humans were referenced as \"wyfman\".\n\nIt can be argued that the disparition of the \"were\" in front of man has more to do with the fact that men are only valued for what they do in society, hence their unique role being fused with the \"hand\", the \"man\" that is used to describe a profession (like in fireman, policeman).\n\nTo argue that the \"man\" in English word refer to men and is sexist is illiterate, and also (ironically since it is feminists we are talking about\" completely American-centric. It forgets that there ever was other languages than English, and that English has shared and borrowed words from all sorts of languages, including in large parts Latin and French. \n\nIt is as incredibly stupid as \"we call it history because it is his story\", when in fact, it comes from historia in Latin (where \"his\" isn't a thing) and it is more likely that the word \"story\" actually comes from a deformation of \"history\" than the other way around.\n\nFeminism never cease to amaze.",

That is a very kafkaesque idea, but it's presented as perfectly rational. It essentially boils down to the claim that \"Some people who share immutable traits with each other bathe in nepotism and secretly run the entire world\" Anyone who disagrees just hasn't drank enough of the Kool-aid or is part of the establishment. \n\nYou will never find an example because the patriarchy as a concept is designed to be unfalsifiable. This is identitarianism 101: the patriarchy is the great bad bogeyman that can be used to do away with all nuance and context, it is the sole proprietor of everything wrong with the world. There are a myriad of things one could point out in order to explain certain discrepancies between men and women be they sociocultural, socioeconomic, psychological, biological, you name it. But that's not how identitarians stay in power, so they have to deliberately use shifty or otherwise vague language and concepts to obfuscate the real issues. \n\nThe problem is that feminism, while trying to foster progress, has become more than a philosophy or belief. It has instead become an institution, and insitutions will always look to protect and expand their own power whereever possible. The underlying philosophy comes second.\n\nThe feminists of the 60s and 70s you might have heard of went into academia, where they got degrees and created departments, where they wrote books etc, They turned feminism into their career, it wasn't just a belief system anymore. Their raison d'tre  hinged on the existence of widespread oppression and a patriarchy. They would be rendered obsolete if this wasn't the case. Naturally, they started inventing problems. Contemporary feminism provides answers to the wrong questions.\n\nI'm paraphrasing because I don't remember who made this point originally, but this tends to happen when interviewers pursue only a single hypothesis that supports what they already think, and ignore any details that counter their hypothesis. The goal is not to get the truth, but to simply corroborate what is already believed. In the case of contemporary feminism, that single hypothesis is the patriarchy.",

But I could see how people are holding onto research themes that make no sense, just because they get funding for it. If they were funded by private corporations, they would long have been gone.   \n\n\nThe word kafkaesque you used is spot on. What has been human's strength since the dawn of  ages is the collaboration between more pragmatic, ambitious, cold-blooded, rational man and the more intuitive, maternal, empathic, emotional and less rational woman. Each trait on each gender can be seen as positive or negative, but they each contribute to a certain balance.  \n\n\nStarting to say that not just knowledge, but in fact the whole rational scientific method are 'oppressive', is one of the most self-destructive ideas that our society could have. Sure - we can't measure everything and see things black/white all the time (as men tend to), but we can't rule a society on hunches and beliefs either (as women tend to).",

                            "body": ">The way the concept of a patriarchy is abused genuinely scares me. Some lunatics even claim that knowledge itself is a product of the patriarchy and that it's therefore an oppressive force. That is a very kafkaesque idea, but it's presented as perfectly rational. It essentially boils down to the claim that \"Some people who share immutable traits with each other bathe in nepotism and secretly run the entire world\" Anyone who disagrees just hasn't drank enough of the Kool-aid or is part of the establishment.\n>\n>You will never find an example because the patriarchy as a concept is designed to be unfalsifiable. This is identitarianism 101: the patriarchy is the great bad bogeyman that can be used to do away with all nuance and context, it is the sole proprietor of everything wrong with the world.\n\nHave you ever actually listened to a feminist? No offense, but this reads like your only interactions with feminists come from Ben Shapiro reks feminists!!! or twitter screenshots of crazy people. Most feminists are rational people so if someone shows you a feminist argument that makes no sense on its face then you should be skeptical that theyre not making a straw man. \n\nFor starters, knowledge isnt oppressive, that obviously makes no sense. Second, feminists dont actually believe in a male Illuminati, patriarchy is more of a social order, which leads into the next point, its not designed to be unfalsifiable its just nebulous. Similarly, socialism is where the workers own the means of production right? What percent of corporations would have to become co-ops before were not capitalist anymore? That doesnt mean capitalism and socialism are unfalsifiable, the line is just blurry. For patriarchy, theres not a hard line for what is and isnt, its more of the sum of social interactions that trend a certain way, like women being pressured to start a family instead of focusing on their career. \n\n> There are a myriad of things one could point out in order to explain certain discrepancies between men and women be they sociocultural, socioeconomic, psychological, biological, you name it. But that's not how identitarians stay in power, so they have to deliberately use shifty or otherwise vague language and concepts to obfuscate the real issues.\n\n>Sociocultural\n\nLike...a system where women are pushed into a homemaker role and men are pushed into a breadwinner role? Like...patriarchy?\n\n>The problem is that feminism, while trying to foster progress, has become more than a philosophy or belief. It has instead become an institution, and insitutions will always look to protect and expand their own power whereever possible. The underlying philosophy comes second.\n\n>The feminists of the 60s and 70s you might have heard of went into academia, where they got degrees and created departments, where they wrote books etc, They turned feminism into their career, it wasn't just a belief system anymore. Their raison d'tre  hinged on the existence of widespread oppression and a patriarchy. They would be rendered obsolete if this wasn't the case. Naturally, they started inventing problems. Contemporary feminism provides answers to the wrong questions.\n\nThis is a strange point because you can apply this logic to basically anything. Is religion not a belief system because you can make a career out of theology? If you work at a nonprofit because you believe in their mission does that make it not a belief of yours? Nowadays both left wing and right wing people can make a career out of arguing their political beliefs on YouTube, does that make it not a belief anymore? Also, can you honestly say women arent pressured into homemaking anymore? Thats the original reason behind the movements in the 60s and 70s so while progress has definitely been made, why do you think there isnt oppression anymore?\n\n>I'm paraphrasing because I don't remember who made this point originally, but this tends to happen when interviewers pursue only a single hypothesis that supports what they already think, and ignore any details that counter their hypothesis. The goal is not to get the truth, but to simply corroborate what is already believed. In the case of contemporary feminism, that single hypothesis is the patriarchy.\n\nId love to see that source if you can find it.",

And certainly, I've seen and heard about social pressures that actually serve to make hypergamy more expected behavior. \n\nI think it's something that's tied into social status competitions. And as I've long been someone who thinks that we need to be more aware and critical of these competitions, I think hypergamy is part of that. But it's not universal.

I have a feeling that that will soon be forgotten again.\n\nOne trend that I'm also wondering about is household cleanliness and how quarantine might impact that.  Are people actually keeping their homes significantly more clean than in the past due to concerns over the pandemic, or might some levels of cleanliness be relaxed due to not having to worry about entertaining guests during this time?

He also takes care of buying and/or preparing the firewood to keep the house warm (not needed as much since 1-2 weeks ago, and I too do my part in this, but you get the idea), keeps the garden in a good state, and fixes most if not all things related to electronics or informatics in the house (so the computers and associated software that allow the three of us to still work from home, the air conditioner...).\n\nHe's also responsible for the maintenance for both of their cars, buying the food (and medicines, sanitizers... Everything that needs buying, he is responsible to get, basically) and storing it in the fridge(s) in an organized way, after the three of us decide what we'll be having for lunch/dinner the next 1-2 weeks (he then makes a plan to *when* we'll be having dish to keep the diet somewhat varied and avoid having to cook too much some days, and not at all others, and to avoid over-filling the fridges).\n\nOn the other hand, my mother keeps the inside of the house (but nothing else) clean and prepares lunch once every two days (my father does so the other day), while either any of them or I prepare dinner (depending on who is \"more available for the task\").\n\nWith the questions presented by the survey, if the article you linked is nything to go by, I would say that in this case my mother would end up being the one my mother would me most of the \"home-schooling\" (if there were any kids), even though my father would be helping a lot by taking work off her shoulders (the time he spends shopping, taking the dogs for a walk, and preparing/fixing all devices that allow the rest of us to do our work comfortably, is time saved up for the rest of us, including for my mother, who could spend it \"home-schooling\"). In a similar way, the question:\n\n> Who is currently most responsible for housework, such as cooking and cleaning?\n\nWould be answered such that my father would be doing at the very least as much, if not more, of the housework, if you look only at the part before the colon. However, he technically does less than half of the cooking and cleaning, which may explain discrepancies in their answers.\n\nSo, basically, most of it comes down to how you ask the questions and how you present the results, in terms of the conclussions they extract. And it comes down to how each couple/family organizes themselves. I got tons of help from both of my parents when I was younger, and would find it insulting if anyone tried to minimize the work **both of them** did that allowed me to (for example) study at the university, be succesfull in getting a degree, then a master, and later on a PhD and a career. They each did their best and helped tons, in different ways, by talking about how to organize themselves, and playing their own roles within those plans.\n\nThis sort of surveys sometimes seem to be looking for specific answers, by looking at how the questions are formulated, and then these answers are usually extrapolated to cover much more than the questions allow to. Thus the way the reports are made, both in terms of the answers themselves and how they are interpreted.",

Pasquerella, for example, is not troubled by the lopsided overrepresentation of women in nursing, she said, because there is no evidence men face stigma or discrimination in that field.\n\nI find that hard to believe. I mean, it's anecdotal to be sure, but I have friends and relatives that have gone through nursing programs, and this wasn't their experience at all. It was actually akin to the worst stories that you hear about women in other courses. \n\n> A paper she co-authored for publication this year -- Choice of Majors: Are Women Really Different From Men? -- reports that girls respond to a variety of influences and are more likely than boys to change majors when they get poor grades in STEM classes. Ironically, female-only programs may diminish their interest and confidence.\n\nTruth is, this is a culture that I think really stands out of if you look at it, and there might be something there there, in certain STEM courses. \"C's get degrees\". \"What do you call a doctor that barely passed their tests. Doctor\" and so on. \n\nI actually think there's something to be explored here, and that this might be where there's a very real socialization gap. The problem is it's not sexy to talk about. Girls and Women tend to place a higher intrinsic value on grades. And then changing it....again, not something we're comfortable talking about. \n\nMy position is clear...I believe that these barriers exist far less in different environments. It's why I encourage things like commuter schools and online learning. If discrimination is a problem...IMO these are the things we can best do to directly address it. But that stuff is probably off the table.\n\nBut I think this sort of results-driven hammering? I don't think it's sustainable, for that very reason. It's too self-contradictory. Unless we're going to straight up say OK, things are going to be draconian until we get to statistical equality, deal with it....but even then, honestly, that's just going to create fights over who gets to be the target of said draconian measures.

We cant even evaluate statistical inequality without looking at other things such as women making up 60 percent of degrees in masters programs. Just to point out how big that difference is and there is no school addressing it.\n\nAlso, I agree that STEM gives out harsher grades and there might be some difference either social or biological that causes that to affect women more. It could be because of inflated grades given for other subjects or if one sex is used to failiure more often that they perform better when failiure is a higher risk. However, we cant get to that conversation because people are trying to balance out percentages, but only ones they feel are discriminatory or that affect women.\n\nThese girls only STEM programs are draconian by the standards you laid out and male advocates are just trying to keep the men from burning to it unfairly.",

Especially when those in power game up with said out-of-date theories, and have a vested interest in maintaining them. \n\n>These girls only STEM programs are draconian by the standards you laid out and male advocates are just trying to keep the men from burning to it unfairly.\n\nI used the wrong word for draconian. I didn't mean harsh per se...I meant one sided. What I meant was we're just going to say, all these programs are just going to be help women. Full stop. They do not apply to men. Just put all the cards on the table. \n\nThe problem is that's not politically viable, I think. It just breaks a basic sense of fairness that I do think is dominant still. As well...I think it just makes the costs too evident. It's not some vague goal...it becomes...yeah...your son has to sacrifice to get the numbers right. Sorry, he has to give up on his dreams. I'm sure you'll make him understand that it's for the greater good. \n\nI think that's why it's not sustainable. That's the other side of the pendulum. We're stuck between a relatively vague commitment to \"equality\", which won't last under scrutiny at a systems/process level, and this other point of not wanting to be thrown under the bus/throw our loved ones under the bus, for the greater good of equality.",

Lets redistribute the success! Equality of outcome!\n\nOh this is a situation where women are outperforming men? Well hands off! Freedom to choose! Freedom of association etc! \n\nThe issue I have is when you are here defending things with freedom of choice and another person defends stuff with equality of outcome . Sometimes both are used by people who only care about womens interest and they either dont understand or act maliciously about how its discriminatory against men.\n\nI would select equality of oppurtunity by the way. I am actually against Title IX existing, but that means I would want everything it affects including sports to be undone. I would like everything judged by that same standard.\n\nThe problem is we have lots of areas where we have redistributive policies which benefit women and areas where women have more rights and/or outperform that should arguably be distributed.\n\nSome examples of redistributive equality policies that benefit women or tend to benefit more women: quotas, child support, Alimony, sports payment/scholarships, marriage/divorce laws, female only programs, gym hours.\n\nSome examples where women have an arguably better deal out of it without any other intervening policy: child custody, paternity laws, womens scholarships, draft, #believewomen, dating, power of sex appeal, FGM/MGM, spending gap\n\nYou can also list some redistributed policies that favor men (bathroom lines based on same size bathrooms in public)\n\nYou can also add non redistributed policies that people argue should be redistributed (Pay Gap, job career choices gap)\n\n\n\nI could add more things to all 4 of these areas. The point is that it is common to see freedom of choice arguements made alongside redistributive ones. (See advocacy for my body my choice and compare it to wage gap). However I look at all these issues and notice that redistributive equality and equality of oppurtunity get men shafted on both ends of it currently, frequently. \n\nI see current advocacy as using both standards, combined. This is no longer equality but a way to use equality as an arguement of convenience to argue for something above equality.\n\nSo, when I argue Title IX, its not because I believe Title IX is the best thing ever, but because I am pointing out the lopsided tendency of advocacy that argues BOTH Outcome and Oppurtunity...picking whichever arguement is convient.\n\nThe goal should be to pick one standard and work towards it. Instead we have the bastardization or arguing as advocacy for women by any standard that can possibly be used to support the arguement.\n\nThis is why I consider my flair to be the most important thing for advocacy in general.

Here is my best attempt to summarize the issue:\n\nMost feminists seem to believe that patriarchy and misogyny are the only valid lens through which to look at mens issues. The ideas of anti-male sexism and misandry are a taboo in feminism. Any double standards that seem to negatively affect men are rationalized as misogyny backfiring. If you talk about an issue where men get the short end of the stick (such as bias in child custody proceedings), feminists are quick to point out that, in fact, patriarchy is responsible for this. If you talk about how men are shamed for showing emotions (by both men and women), feminists are quick to point out that this is a result of misogyny  that showing emotion is considered feminine and thus inferior. Therefore the blame falls on patriarchy again. \n\nTo a non-feminist, this leads to the impression that feminists are blaming men (as a class) for all gender-based unfairness. In fact, the eagerness with which feminists blame patriarchy suggests that they think its very important that everyone understands exactly where the blame should lie (on men).\n\nFeminists, do you agree with the perception that you blame men, as a class, for most (or all) gender-based unfairness? Do you think that its important to acknowledge that the blame lies on men? Where do you think the balance falls between class-based and individual repsonsibility?\n\nIs it possible for feminists and progressive MRA's to reconcile this difference of opinion?",

I'm not smart or a social scientist, I don't read books by feminists or follow feminist twitter accounts, so don't ask me to defend this or that feminist figure.\n\nBut I think that patriarchy isn't really men's fault. It's the fault of conservatism, maybe. Gender roles exist for a reason, but they're outdated now.

I hope we can get some feminists perspectives on addressing this, as there are feminists who do not think like this (sadly they are not the ones in power).

Making a campaign against him so he stepped down and it never went ahead:\n\n>Olivia Bailey, NUS national women's officer, said: \"Discrimination against men on the basis of gender is so unusual as to be non-existent, so what exactly will a men's society do?\" \"To suggest that men need a specific space to be 'men' is ludicrous, when everywhere you turn you will find male-dominated spaces,\" she added.\n\nI mean just one rebuttal to that is men are a minority in university.

Pointing to the history is useful because you can appreciate the steps it took to get to a certain place and which tactics were effective. It also opens a window into what aspects still needs progress.\n\n>Why the need to always take anti-male sexism and re-label it as misogyny?\n\nA lot of male sexism is about living up to a patriarchal male ideal.",

People in general associate bullying with middle school when kids undergo puberty, but it still continues for me... \n\nI *wish* that my *only* problem with ugliness was the lack of success with women. I found many copes like vidya, movies, and dog to cope with loneliness. It's painful to be alone but it's possible to go on. \n\nBut bullying absolutely destroys my mentality and will to live. It happens almost weekly. I've developed social anxiety, and depression. I cannot go outside feeling safe. I have missed all my lectures in the past 3 months and when I did go outside, I was met with more bullying. I cannot do my favorite sport, I can't even go shopping because I will be met with smirks and looks of disgust. This is the life of ugly man. \n\n*Who are the bullies?* It's mostly women - educated medical students that will soon become doctors. *What do they say?* Mostly \"eew\", \"hell no\", \"he is ugly\"....\n\nFor instance, last Wednesday we had an exam. I was standing in line with earphones when I hear an \"eew\" and then 4 girls in front turned around and looked at my face with spite. How am I supposed to be confident? How can I become a doctor when I cannot look in people's eyes from bullying? FML. \n\nI am clean. I shower twice a day. I shave and have a professional haircut. I use Chanel. I ride a scooter.

            "body": "Until I took the blackpillI thought this was supposed to be a term of enlightenment, people on the old incel subs would say \"Feed him a blackpill before he ropes!\" or things similar. But I've seen a lot of posts of self-loathing and suicidal tendencies that tell me otherwise. What I want to know is why? Why do you all have to hate yourselves for something you had no control over? You didn't ask to be born, you didn't ask to exist in this shitty looksist world. It makes no sense to me to beat yourselves up over being alone, especially if your blackpilled and acknowledge there is little you can do in the way of genetics.\n\nI was like you at one point in time; I hated myself and wanted to die for not being able to attract girls. However, that was when I was bluepilled/ redpilled, when I thought I actually had a chance. I truly thought the reason I wasn't attracting girls was because it was all MY FAULT, that wasn't being assertive, charming, charismatic or acting confident enough, not being enough of a haughty douche. Every time I developed a crush on a girl, I truly thought it was something I had control over, and that if I got rejected and saw her with some 6'5\" muscled-out gorilla- looking-man days later, it was because I had fucked up my presentation, that I had my chance with her but I blew it.\n\nThen one day, after the truth had chiseled away at me long enough to finally break me, I had finally became fully blackpilled. I won't go into detail how it happened; it took forever, a death-by-a-thousand-cuts scenario, best saved for another post. When I took the blackpill though, it was like a tremendous weight had finally been lifted. Not only did I stop hating myself, but I was able to move on and focus on other things that actually made me happy and love myself. I no longer cared what girls or really anyone thought of me; you'll never impress everyone anyway, so why get shook-up over it?\n\nFor example, I was at the local archery range the other day, bettering my aim, when an attractive young lady walked in and took a spot near me. Now I'll admit, my natural instincts caused me to let my guard down and let her in my head. I instantly put pressure on myself to shoot really good and not mess up to impress her, which in turn of course stressed me out bad. But then I quickly came to my senses and told to myself, \"Even if I was the human version of Legolas, there's no way I could flatter her. That would only be if I was a 6'5\" muscled-out nordic chad. Hell, I could be complete shit at archery then, and she would be chomping at the bit to come over and assist me, so she could touch and adjust my arms and feel my muscles and shit.\"\n\nAnd just like that, I calmed down, my mental state was restored, and I was able to go back to enjoying myself and focusing on shooting.\n\nNow I know some of you are going to say \"I wish I could have a girl adore me like that.\" Or \"I'll never experience being touched romantically and sensually.\"\n\nWell, so what? Why should you care if other people don't like you? If you haven't already, you'll come to learn that 90% of the people you meet are just a bunch of miserable dick-assed weirdos who only enjoy putting others down to make themselves feel better about their own shitty ass lives. They are not worth pleasing.\n\nAlso, a lot of people won't get to experience a lot of things. Blind people will never get to see their own face. Deaf people will never get to hear their own voice. A few years ago, there was this four-year-old kid in my town who had to have all of his limbs amputated, or else this horrible genetic medical condition  would kill him. Now he will never get to experience walking, running, jumping or playing, or opening his own birthday presents or taking care of himself or anything really for the rest of his life.\n\nMy point is, yes life is terrible, yes life is filled with suffering, but that doesn't mean YOU  HAVE to be miserable every second of every day. As a human being, you are capable of many more amazing things than you realize. As a 25 y/o virgin, I have found so many amazing things to do that made me realize just how amazing I am as a person, and they don't involve having a romantic partner; some of these activities are even more enjoyable when you're alone.\n\nNow I'm sure a lot of you are going to say that I'm just copemaxxing or something. Maybe you're right, maybe it is cope, but then again, maybe it's not. After all, some of these things, to me, like going on outdoor adventures, hunting, fishing, and hiking the AT, PCT, and CDT, feel BIGGER than just settling down with a wife and kids and becoming fully domesticated and tethered down like so many other people do. Plus, being single has it's advantages, like having a 0% chance of ruining your life by having a kid on accident.\n\nThe bottom line is, you only live once, you might as well try and enjoy life while you still have it. If the ladies don't like you, then don't sweat it. IT is right, no one is entitled to anything, especially if it involves another person. After all, no one here would like being forced to do something against their will. If girls don't pay you any mind, then fuck it! Who needs them? You can't please everyone, so don't even try. Please don't live to try and please other people, does your one-and-only life belong to those assholes, or you? Live for yourself and no one else. When the world turns its back on you, you turn your back on it! Normies will say that this is not a healthy mindset, but normies have proven themselves to be full of shit with their so-called \"advice.\" Hating yourself and wanting to commit violence against yourself for something you had no say in is not a healthy mindset either.\n\nWhen someone takes the blackpill it shouldn't mean the end of their life, it should mark the beginning of a new one, filled with self-love and acceptance!\n\nTL;DR: Taking the blackpill should not make you sad, it should be and indication that you are free to live for yourself. It should disarm all of your self-loathing and tell you that most people are horrible and that their opinions are worthless. Do not just LDAR. Save the LDARing for when you're dead, after you've enjoyed your life to the fullest.",

Last month, for example, Beijing expelled three *Wall Street Journal* reporters in retribution for an opinion column titled China Is the Real Sick Man of Asia. *China Daily*, a Communist Party [mouthpiece,](https://global.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202002/07/WS5e3cab20a310128217275a06.html) declared the headline astonishingly racistdespite the fact the term sick man is routinely used idiomatically to [describe countries](https://www.ft.com/content/5a629584-610a-11e9-a27a-fdd51850994c) facing economic challenges, and isnt connected to the Coronavirus outbreak.  \n>  \n>In January, the Chinese embassy in Denmark [demanded an apology](https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202001/29/WS5e309fb4a31012821727381f.html) after a Danish newspaper printed a cartoon related to the Coronavirus outbreak: a Chinese flag with virus icons where the stars should be. Embassy staff stated flatly that the cartoon is an insult to China and hurts the feelings of the Chinese people. In 2018, similarly, [Chinas ambassador in Ottawa](https://www.macleans.ca/politics/worldpolitics/the-lies-and-insults-that-china-has-pointed-at-canada/) said Canadas arrest of a politically connected Chinese tech executive was motivated by white supremacy. (Beijing then retaliated by [arresting two Canadians](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-50592055) in China.)\n\nThe author, Thomas Brown, also spotlights both unethical media behavior and hypocrisy on the PRC's end:\n\n>Yet we must also be aware that the Chinese government has learned to weaponize our own progressive tendencies, and has learned to exploit false accusations of racism against democratic societies. Ironically, this same Chinese regime encourages racism and xenophobia domestically.  \n>  \n>Government-controlled Chinese media routinely stirs up nationalist hostilities. And Chinese television frequently plays on racial stereotypes. Chinas biggest Lunar New Year television show, with an audience in the hundreds of millions, in 2018 [featured skits](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/society/article/2133558/racist-chinese-spring-festival-gala-tv-show-causes-consternation) with a black man playing a monkey and a woman in blackface with a huge posterior. In one [2016 ad for laundry detergent](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/28/china-racist-detergent-advert-outrage), a Chinese woman stuffed a detergent pod into a black mans mouth and shoved him into a washing machine. Out popped a pale-skinned Chinese man.  \n>  \n>The *Global Times*, a state media outlet, is well known for [inflammatory, offensive editorials](https://qz.com/745577/inside-the-global-times-chinas-hawkish-belligerent-state-tabloid/) about foreign countries. One declared that should Australia continue flights over the South China Sea it would be a shame if one day a plane fell from the sky and it happened to be Australian.\n\nGiven how the Chinese Communist Party is [already doing an amplified version of all of the above](https://twitter.com/RealSaavedra/status/1238349802338807808) in an attempt to deflect complicity in the coronavirus outbreak and blame the US for its own bungling...yeah, it's got global ramifications.",

I will refer to him as David here, however this of course is not his real name and I will not provide any identifying details even if asked.\n\nDavid is considering trying to withdraw his guilty plea, for the following reasons:\n\nWhat happened:\n\n1. Five minutes before his plea was due, whilst at the court, he was told the prosecution had completely rewritten the description of the charges against him, to which he claims to be innocent of and has much proof of.\n2. He was told by his solicitor he 'will' be found guilty of the new charge by a jury because they will all hate him and ignore his evidence.\n3. He was told he will not get 1/3 off his sentence if he does not admit his guilt right there and then. He was told it would be expensive to defend himself and that pleading guilty will save everyone a lot of money.\n4. He argued with his solicitor that it did not feel right but minutes later they were called to the court room.\n5. As he walked to the courtroom with his solicitor he was told again he should say guilty when asked.\n6. Just before he was asked to plea the judge offered an adjournment of a few days to allow defence to consider the rewritten charge, however his solicitor declined the offer without consulting my friend at all.\n7. During the plea itself the defence solicitor mouthed plead guilty multiple times at my friend as he hesitated.\n8. The rewritten charge arbitrarily changed the period of the offence from a couple of months, to a whole year and included additional un-provable claims not stated before.\n9. Later he was told that he could put in a basis of plea setting out his version of events and disputing certain accusations that form the charge. The basis of plea was then submitted but the CPS is saying they will not accept it because it was not agreed at the time of the plea hearing.\n\nIn addition to the above, David is suffering from chronic depression, officially homeless, often suicidal and very, very vulnerable at this time. As a result, he is very easily influenced and due to the nature of the charges, finds if very hard to argue his innocence without people saying he sounds more guilty by doing so, or he is minimising the offence.\n\nIANAL but from my understanding of both the evidence and his explanations. I do not believe him guilty of this crime, although I admit I may be biased and it is a complicated case. He is in a really terrible place at the moment and I want to help him as best I can before what I believe is a miscarriage of justice occurs.\n\nPlease could someone advise how he might go about asking to withdraw his plea, if this is even possible given the circumstances. His own solicitor has threatened to resign from the case if my friend tries to change his plea now, leaving him undefended with very little time to act before his sentencing.",

One of his exswho was notorious for being feminist to the point that the word was almost synonymous with her namealso came forward with a false rape accusation. Even more people got pissed off and took up the MeToo ideology. Police had to escort my friend wherever he went bc he actually got jumped a few times \n\nFortunately, no legal action was taken against him. Eventually it all blew over but several still thought my friend was in the wrong after it since they never listened to the truth. Now, my friend asks for permission to do simple things such as hug, shake hands, high five, help someone up, etcall because hes worried someone will toss him a false accusation if he doesnt hear clear consent for simple interactions.....its really messed up",

Also dont fret to much over blue piller friends unless they are an actual danger to yourself. I have some great blue pill friends who are slowly slowly turning red.

Two fortnights ago, a Mrs. Bothby, a scolding and shrewish woman of ponderous comportment, made the mistake of crossing me in a forward manner. I alerted the parsons and had her in a wheelbarrow brought, stripped naked to her smock, and hoisted on the ducking stool for her insolence. In the twilight, after a day in the stool, she cried out to me, but I said naught as I calmly sipped my roadside chai and chatted with a passing rickshaw driver.",

MGTOW is becoming the norm.Based on the number of cases, studies and articles in power imbalance, in divorce cases, in percentages of relationships/marriages failing, in double standards, the adele divorce case, the Johnny Depp case... men have realized the following:\n\n1 - The term *SIMP* has achieved a global status (i would not be surprised that it would be included in the dictionary sometime in the future). This means that a conscious realization has occurred, and for it having such a mass appeal worldwide, it means that it isn't just cultural relativism/subjectivism. Millions of men have suffered through the dichotomy of -> Conquering Women = Suffering, otherwise the term *SIMP* needn't be so sucessful;\n\n2 - With the pragmatic, yet flawed, #METOO movement, men have spoken how much they suffered from this view of trying to be with women. This point with 1 has something in common: Something is really all fucked concerning approaching women. \"*This shouldn't be so difficult...so why is it? Is it me that's the problem?\";*\n\n3 - Seeing so many men suffering from this exact way (and it not need mattering if a man is a 2/10 or a 10/10. Suffering from women is human condition on heterosexual men, it seems) and ourselves just being tired of trying and being better ourselves everyday to reach that goal of having everlasting love with a woman, we reach a conclusion: *Something is definitely not right about relationships/women nowadays* (otherwise there wouldn't be so many niche groups like mgtow/men's rights/whereareallthegoodmen. It's reactionary and even error theory assuming that \"*we're all losers and incels\". Correlation doesn't mean Causation*, however, when that correlation continues to go on without stopping, a conclusion has to be made);\n\n4 - With such a conclusion, we go searching for more information: We find books (the manipulated men, the rational male, the works of Briffault), we find articles (divorce rapes, cheating scandals, emotional bullying cases), and, eventually, this kind of subreddit, MGTOW (maybe TRP). With the axioms that these subreddits apply...well, they just make sense. Everything fits. We start to connect the pieces. Briffaults's Law, Hypergamy, Monkey Branching, abandoning relationships for no reason, Shit Tests...It's impossible for this to be just me! Every guy i've known has suffered through the exact same way. So we start talking to our male friends... and we all agree on these premisses.\n\n5 - We, naturally, keep reading and being informed about this. We start living without the necessity of having a girlfriend, a woman in our lives, and just stop (or limit) our necessity of approaching women. We start to live more. We are more sane. We are healthier (some of us even go to the gym!). We start taking care of ourselves for ourselves. We start not caring about social media.\n\n6 - Now that we are a better person and know these truths about modernity, and are simply better not caring about women (although this is really difficult and only a select few can outright not have that human condition pull on women), we start not giving a crap. Women start complaining that we are not paying attention or that we have become lazy. Feminism and social media start using debilitating words like *Incel, Loser* or *Beta* to shame test us (like we haven't predicted that by this point). You know, a typical Strawmen/Ad Hominem.\n\n7 - The cycle repeats here. Now, with our knowledge about this concern, we appropriate other males that give attention to other females to have sexual needs validated (onlyfans, twitch girls, youtube girls, e-girls) and call them by reason, to wake them up. \"Why do you think that onlyfans exploded? It's not because they can't get employability or good jobs. It's not because it's \"difficult\" out there. Prosmicuity and sexual themes have exploded in the past decade, and females are the bread winner. They can have their cake and eat it. They can have more sexual partners and be paid for it, without having any beneficial labour for the rest of society. They can go on any social dating app and just pick. *You are NOT going to have sex with her*.\"\n\nMGTOW is the way. Suffering is bound to happen without it.",

Besides ourselves. \n\nI've discovered not giving a shit about most people (especially women and children) and caring about myself more. Not in an extreme way or anything. Just knowing that I am the center of my experience in this reality, and I shouldn't give up anything I can gain to anyone else just because they're a kid or a woman.\n\nWe as men are only as important as we make ourselves, because no one else is going to make us important for us. If that makes sense. Women and children are made important for just existing. This is why they require so much more attention and reassurance. They're addicted to validation.",

Asked whether the number could be as a high as a thousand, Rackauckas said, I think so.\n\nA few months later, though, Rackauckas was out of office, replaced by current DA Todd Spitzer, who eventually ordered a review of the evidence. He says he was appalled by what he found.\n\n**The prior District Attorney and his chief of staff manufactured this case and repeatedly misstated the evidence to lead the public and vulnerable women to believe that these two individuals plied up to 1,000 women with drugs and alcohol in order to sexually assault themand videotape the assaults, Spitzer said in a blistering statement.**\n\nAs a result of the complete case review I ordered beginning in July, **we now know that there was not a single video or photograph depicting an unconscious or incapacitated woman being sexually assaulted.**\n\nRackauckas has not responded to his former rivals allegations. But Robicheauxs attorney praised the reversal...\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nStory continues at [https://www.yahoo.com/news/da-says-couple-accused-drugging-025144677.html](https://www.yahoo.com/news/da-says-couple-accused-drugging-025144677.html)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo the next time you hear how Bill Cosby must be guilty, just look at all of his accusers, think real hard about it.  If a DA could literally find 1000 accusers out of thin air that a new DA has determined to all be fake, every single one, all of a suddenly it becomes much more plausible that a congo line of fake accusers be rolled out against any man.  Come on, if there was really all that much rape out there, do you think the DAs would have to be inventing ones that don't exist?",

Therefore, when a marriage is breaking up at the insistence of either the breadwinning wife or the supported husband, the lawyer has to apprise the client that when a big-earner wife comes in, the court bends over backward to be gender-neutral, and it is possible the bum is going to be rewarded for sitting on his hands. You do a flip-flop and make believe she is a guy.\n\n> More often than not, this doesnt involve alimony.

I think this is also why they're so hostile to the idea of people even on this sub even talking about women abusing men because it makes them uncomfortable.

You can do the same with beans and rice, but they don't store quite as well, and you can do the same with pasta which also stores well.\n\nEnd result .. no worries, because you can prep long term with these kinds of dry goods for as long as you want, really .. and yeah, it might not be fun to sit around doing nothing but eating bread and drinking water, but you'd survive.\n\nI mean if you were super worried about some meteor hitting the earth or something, you could literally have half a U.S. standard short ton of wheat (1000lb) for 800 USD, which is like 1.5 MILLION CALORIES ... which at 2000 calories a day would last you like 700 days ..\n\nWith enough storage space and about as much money as a car you could probably buy enough wheat or pasta to literally feed you for the rest of your natural life, and just check \"food\" off your list.",

I'm not sure why or how they are expecting straight men to stop talking about what they find attractive in the opposite sex. \n\nWomen are quite unapologetic about their preferences and will often let you know about their minimum height requirements ( which tend to be stricter and less flexible than men's preferences). how they like men with facial hair ( 1/4 men can't grow a beard ), their ideal penis size, etc.. Anyone who has been on dating apps knows how \" in your face \" women can be when [talking about a man's physique](https://i.redd.it/rsqzruu8axk21.jpg). Men's feelings aren't really taken into consideration here. You're just supposed to come to terms with your physical image and draw your self-esteem from somewhere else. \n\nMen, on the other hand, are expected to play by a different set of rules.

OLD and hookup apps are heavily biased in favor of women and very physically attractive men. \n\n2. For men not in the top 20% genetically as far as looks go, meeting in person at a bar or party or other social venue is their best bet at pursuing women and giving themselves a chance to act attractively in a way that cannot be shown easily through an OLD profile. \n\nWell, now we are living in a time where it is unclear if bars or concert venues or even restaurants will ever return to the way they once were. Even when these establishments open back up its guaranteed that they will have to do so while observing social distancing protocols, limiting the number of patrons and perhaps even the kinds of interactions patrons can have. \n\nBasically, almost every single kind of public socializing venue is going to either close permanently or see up to 50% cuts in patronage and profitability, enforced either legally by public health officials, or emerging naturally because people will just be too spooked to go out in large crowds, probably for the foreseeable future. \n\nSo what's going to happen to dating?\n\nPeople will obviously still need to meet up and have sex, so workarounds will be found. Online dating already accounts for almost half of new relationships, and I think its pretty clear that this trend will accelerate in post pandemic Western society. I can easily see a future where people are posting negative COVID results on their profiles and going about meeting new sex partners privately, rather than risking going into public and exposing oneself to potentially thousands of unverified disease vectors. \n\nAnd, of course, for already naturally risk-averse women, anything less than Chad is now completely not worth the risk. \n\nSo, take away billy beta's one way of appearing attractive to new women and up the risks of meeting anyone new such that only the Chadliest are worth the effort for women, and, well...\n\nThat 30% sexlessness rate for young men is going to spike *hard* in the next two years.",

They spend most of their lives in the water, but come ashore to mate, give birth, molt or escape from predators, such as sharks and killer whales. They feed largely on fish and marine invertebrates; a few, such as the leopard seal, feed on large vertebrates, such as penguins and other seals. Walruses are specialized for feeding on bottom-dwelling mollusks. Male pinnipeds typically mate with more than one female (polygyny), although the degree of polygyny varies with the species. The males of land-breeding species tend to mate with a greater number of females than those of ice breeding species. Male pinniped strategies for reproductive success vary between defending females, defending territories that attract females and performing ritual displays or lek mating. Pups are typically born in the spring and summer months and females bear almost all the responsibility for raising them. Mothers of some species fast and nurse their young for a relatively short period of time while others take foraging trips at sea between nursing bouts. Walruses are known to nurse their young while at sea. Seals produce a number of vocalizations, notably the barks of California sea lions, the gong-like calls of walruses and the complex songs of Weddell seals.\n\nThe meat, blubber and fur coats of pinnipeds have traditionally been used by indigenous peoples of the Arctic. Seals have been depicted in various cultures worldwide. They are commonly kept in captivity and are even sometimes trained to perform tricks and tasks. Once relentlessly hunted by commercial industries for their products, seals and walruses are now protected by international law. The Japanese sea lion and the Caribbean monk seal have become extinct in the past century, while the Mediterranean monk seal and Hawaiian monk seal are ranked endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. Besides hunting, pinnipeds also face threats from accidental trapping, marine pollution, and conflicts with local people.",

Gen z are those born from 1997 onwards.\n\nIt seems like a lot of men in the millennial and gen z age range are really struggling with the sexual marketplace and finding a partner. Judging from my own observations and the discussion I read on the internet (not just on reddit, but across different social media platforms and forums). Women just consider them invisible. Large portions of them aren't having any sex at all, a lot less than previous generations, which means they won't get the chance to have kids unless that changes.\n\nIn contrast, it seems like the vast majority of gen x men and boomer men found life partners relatively easily. It seems extremely rare to find a 40+ year old man who hasn't been married, had kids nor had at least one long term partner (unless they are a Chad, but at least they are getting regular sex).\n\nMen are told a lot on here that most men end up finding a partner and having kids, but do you think this will be true of millennial men and gen z men?

            "body": "People assume any approach is a sexual approach because it's no longer common to have casual friendsApparently a portion of people below the age of 30 think a man inviting a woman over for a drink is a form of sexual harassment. And this mentality appears to have spread to many fields of daily life; if anyone talks to me it's because they want to fuck me.\n\nAnd I thought, why do people think like this now? This idea that if anyone of the opposite sex interacts with you there's a high chance they're just interested in getting you to bed.\n\nIt's technology and the rise of voluntary self-isolation. That's the cause. Over the past 30 years people in developed countries have learned to spend more time connected to their electronic devices than actually talking to others in bars, cafes, etc. How many people of the overall population spend 3 hours a day chatting with friends, neighbors, coworkers and acquaintances in person? And how many spend 3 hours a day browsing the internet?\n\nEven mundane things like talking with your neighbors or trying to spark a conversation at a bus stop. People, especially younger people, just prefer to stick to their phone, and doing otherwise is often seen as an awkward attempt to converse with a complete stranger. Many folks don't even consider the idea because they have no interest in talking to people around them at all.\n\n[A study by YouGov found that people below the age of 25 had the fewest friends and the fewest acquaintances](https://today.yougov.com/topics/lifestyle/articles-reports/2019/07/30/loneliness-friendship-new-friends-poll-survey), meaning they're lonelier than people of older age groups. Every new generation appears to do worse in this aspect so it is safe to assume the generation younger than this one, Generation Z or \"Zoomers\", will be even lonelier. And this definitely has been influenced, very likely to a high degree, maybe even directly caused, by the raise of personal devices.\n\nHaving friends of the opposite sex that you have no interest in dating or having sex with has become such a rare situation that most people don't even consider that scenario as a possibility. Everyone assumes that if a man shows interest in a woman or if a woman shows interest in a man there must be, by necessity, some sexual interest between the two of them.\n\nIn fact, this even affects people of the same sex. It is becoming more and more difficult to present [male friendships without people assuming the dudes are gay inside](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/bb/42/51/bb4251056186c8c04dc36e8a76ce0f97.jpg), to the point where folks [insist that two cartoon characters are gay simply to pitch them together](https://www.thegamer.com/stop-lying-nintendo-cj-and-flick-are-gay/). I have seen this among my friends, both women and men: every time two guys show any more affection than a fist bump or a high five several people comment if they're bi or not. My friends laughed at the 1917 movie because for them two guys being friends during war is definitely a sign they're gay.\n\nEDIT: This has even affected soooo many comics characters like Wolverine and freaking everyone. You have a social outcast, a depressed loner, a dude from another era who has seen all his friends die and hates himself and struggles to even get by and one day he manages to make a friend despite the brutal depression, like Nightcrawler or Bucky or whatever, and they hang out and tell each other their insecurities and drink beer together and... It's wholesome, they finally made exactly what they needed: a friend. And then a gay writer comes along and goes \"This is going to be sexual now, this is now driven by sexual interests instead of friendship or camaraderie. I know it's toxic to sexualize and romanticize depression and suicidal thoughts, but you know what these characters need? Gay sex.\"\n\n**Despite the social isolation** and the raise of friendlessness, there is one aspect of life that can never be satisfied without physical contact: sex. People have become less likely to go out to make friends, but more likely to go out to get laid. The impulse to have sex still drives people to talk to strangers and younger generations have become more open about casual sex and approaching strangers with the clear intent of fucking.\n\nAs a result of this, if you get approached by a stranger in public, the chances of them wanting to be your friend are lower than ever before in history and at the same time the chances of them wanting to bang you are highest than ever before.\n\n**Change My View**: People assume the worst of any interaction because wanting to make friends has become less common than ever but openly wanting to fuck has become more common than ever.",

I have a question for all the parents who didn't want to have kids and now have them - has life changed for better or for worse? Is it worth having kids? And for all the parents who always wanted to have kids and now regret having them.\n\nWHY do you regret it or WHY are you happy? Be honest, please. \n\nMe (f28) and my partner (m29) have been together for almost 10 years. Recently we've been having more and more fights about having kids - he doesn't want them and I do. I know you think it's stupid to discuss kids after 10 years of being together. A quick backstory is that when we were dating for about two years, he said to me that he wanted to have a baby with me someday. Over the years he was becoming more and more red pill, saw the negative sides of having kids and told me a few years ago that he doesn't want to have kids (and I get that, there are a lot of bad sides of parenting). The problem is that we love each other so much. We are soulmates. But we know whether we have or we don't have kids, one of us will probably be unhappy. But if I leave him, I know I'll be miserable becuse I love him so much. I also think there is a LOW chance that I meet some other guy who I will love as much as my partner now and who will want to have kids. Me and my partner really get along. I know if I end up leaving him I'll just be miserable.\n\nSo I am obviously wondering if we ever end up having kids afterall, how much chance there is for him to be happy. (I'm not intending to get pregnant \"by accident\" because that means I'll be intentionally ruining his life.)\n\nSo ... what's your story? Thanks!",

I have been reading and re-reading the Surrendered Wife in the past year and a half, as well as listening to Laura Doyle's podcasts. I just get confused because there's so much in her theories that makes it seem like nearly every marriage situation IS salvageable. She even came out to say that she now doesn't agree with the statements in her first book about not surrendering to men in specific situations, like for example addictions. I've read columns where she interviews women who have never even really respected their husbands from the beginning, and they most certainly didn't vet, BUT they applied the skills and they have transformed their marriages. It seems to me that here in this sub there's a lot of emphasis on proper vetting, and that if you don't do that you can't find a real captain and therefore you really can't or shouldn't submit. So, I'm just wondering if there's gray area with that? Doyle seems nearly totally convinced that any situation can be turned around. What do you all think?",

I had already said yes based on emotion, but wanted to really rationally think every aspect through. The fact that we have the same outlook on many things and can truly operate as a team has made our journey into marriage and especially parenthood much easier, compared to friends who were very much in love but not necessarily on the same page about a lot of things. \n\nI guess what I am saying is that everyone can climb the hill towards a good relationship, but vetting can make you start half way up instead of at the bottom.",

It would be ackward to give examples of women for whom her advice didn't work! All self help experts should be taken with a grain (bag?) of salt.\n\nIn any case, the previous commenter makes a good case for vetting. I think Athol Kay (former RP blogger for men) wrote that a man's goal when picking a wife should be having the happiest family life possible, not marrying into problems and trying to rescue a woman. I'd say this applies to women as well.\n\nObviously, vetting isn't perfect...people change, you may not really know what a person is really like until a crisis hits post-marriage (job loss, serious illness, pandemic, heh).

Sometimes its toxic manipulation. \n\nBut when something occurs that is so offensive to you that you realize youve been lying to yourself to maintain the peace. Then you snap, and its very painful. Plenty of divorces initiated from either party come from the straw that broke the camels back. \n\nAs I said, this could be friendships, or even something like a sibilings relationship. You forgive, you accept, you think about the bigger picture, and then you snap (if the relationship is toxic)\n\nIt could be a job, so you rationalize that the pay is low, but its close, or they are lenient about you sick parent being frequently hospitalized, but your coworkers get offered more opportunities. Some of these things seem fair so you just reassure yourself with the positives, until one day you realized you wasted 5 years of your career, or opportunities to be more present with your children, with nothing to show for it. \n\nRelationships with men are the same. Yes, you should do the things that Laura Doyle speaks of with a man who DESERVES it. Thats the point of vetting. And seriously, ignoring addiction issues? Women who were stuck in loveless marriages with losers, mean spirited, addicted, cheating partners is what caused the feminist wave of the 60s and 70s. You can try and try and try to be a doormat, or pray, or forgive, but thats not a good relationship. Its not healthy for you. Its just convenient for him. \n\nThe purpose of vetting is to find a man that will make your love easy, make your love flow naturally, and spontaneously, a life where conflict makes you feel protected and trustful, not fully responsible for just letting things slide under the rug. Find a man who is responsible, responsible for his own life, and respectful of the emotional support you will provide. \n\nBeing feminine is not about being repressed. So pick a good one.",

The tops are adjustable so I loosen them up and slip an arm out when I need to nurse. The tops are also lined so I can get away with not wearing bras with them, even with white ones. I like the midi style cause I feel like theyre more functional while doing housework, but they have shorter ones too. \n\nAs far as bras go when I want a real bra while Im going out and dont have to constantly pull my boobs out I wear a Demi bra from Victoria secret. All other times, which is most of the time, I wear a bralette. They surprisingly give me a pretty good amount of support. I also just found wireless push-up bras from aerie and Im excited to try those out. I hate feeling floppy but also hate underwire when Im breastfeeding. \n\nCant think of anything else right now, but if I do Ill let you know.

Well, I don't know if I need advice, a slap in the face, a shoulder to cry on, or just to commiserate - I guess I just need some context. My husband and I have been married for a year and a half and we have a 7.5 month old son. I'm really struggling with the transition from purely homemaker to include being a stay-at-home-mom. My husband works a great job and we have always been in agreement that our ideal situation would have me staying at home looking after our children.\n\nI feel like I'm currently not meeting my own expectations or my husband's expectations of what I should be doing at this point. The first few months were absolutely survival, we both knew that going into it, but now that we've found more of a routine with the baby I'm struggling even more now that there's more expectations of me. The idea that there's zero \"time off\" from motherhood is really eating at me in a way I hadn't anticipated.\n\nI end up feeling slightly resentful and come off as ungrateful to my husband when his job \"ends\" and he gets a break in the evenings. He frequently works on things at home (he'll VPN onto work and check things during some evenings and on weekends) so it's not that he only works during the day and lounges for the rest. However, I get up and cover anything that our son needs between bedtime (around 7pm) and I'll get up anywhere between 6-8am and look after him for his first wake-window. Neither of us are morning people, so I find myself envying my husband who gets to stay in bed until 9 or 10. Partially for the sleep, but partially because he gets the opportunity to stay up late to enjoy his hobbies where I feel pressure to get to bed early so I'm not absolutely dead for a 6am wakeup.\n\nWe counter this problem once in a while by my husband taking the first wake-up. I'll get up and feed our son and he'll get up and spend an hour or two with him so I can get back to bed. This is usually a great treat but it's not feasible for him to do it super often and I feel a lot of guilt asking him to get up earlier on a work day or after I know he's been up late.\n\nA lot of things I previously enjoyed as a homemaker (cleaning, cooking, general errands) don't bring me joy in the same way now that it's a juggling act with a baby. Even though I really enjoy making food for my husband, I get frustrated and anxious about getting groceries or meal planning and frequently ask if we can get take-out instead, which in turn makes me feel like I'm doing a bad job. I try and stay on top of the laundry and dishes pretty well, but the overall state of our house is not something I'm proud of. \n\nMy husband is an absolutely awesome dad and he's so willing to be involved and help when he can around his work schedule. I honestly love being a mom too, it's just been really hard that I don't feel like I get to be anything but a mom anymore. I'm half and half breastfeeding and pumping (about 4x each per day). If the baby isn't up, I'm usually hooked up to my breastpump, cooking/doing dishes, or doing laundry. I get a couple hours in the evening where I can take part in my hobbies, but by that point I'm usually so exhausted that I crash and get to bed as soon as possible. Any energy for physical intimacy with my husband is almost a distant memory at this point.\n\nAnyways all of this aside I just feel like there's a normal amount of adjustment to being a new parent, but I feel like I'm on the verge of just not coping whatsoever. I'm having multiple breakdowns a month and I feel like I'm putting a lot of extra burden on my husband.  Is it just going to be hard until baby is X months/years old? I feel some added pressure since my husband is facing a possible big promotion where his workload will increase drastically and he won't be able to help as much as he is now. We also want more kids eventually, but I'm barely hanging on with one as it is. \n\nMy husband was speaking to an older work colleague over the phone the other day and they were discussing a conference that was moving to online. They have evening discussions and my husband said that he'd try and be present once our baby was down for the night. The colleague was surprised that I wouldn't be able to handle doing that by myself and asked what I would be doing if he was having to travel and be at conferences in person. That's been eating at me for a little bit ever since it came up. The last couple of times my husband had to travel for work, my parents came to stay with me to help out (we're in the US and they're in Canada, so they've had to cancel all pending travel for the time being).\n\nFor those of you that have kids, do you have any tips on how to cope with the big life change? Did I just miss the boat on maternal selflessness that other women figured out before they had kids?",

I don't have kids, but I have done a lot of research into this situation, and witnessed it with my friends.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou've gotta remember, historically, women were NOT alone during this time. Their husbands might be working - but they had neighbors, extended family, and usually older children to help out. You're doing it on your own! Realistically, it's an absolute slog (no matter how much you love it). Can you get some help from your mum or mother in law, or a friend, or a neighbor? Can you hire a babysitter once or twice a week?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn terms of communicating with your husband: it's okay to tell him that you're struggling with being on-call 24/7. It would feel like your body isn't your own - I know that being 'touched out' is something a lot of mums feel. You need self-care - a bath by yourself, a chance to read a book out of earshot of crying, etc. A good man will understand that!",

Mine are 8 and 5  and it does get better as they grow and gain some independence. You'll find time more time for yourself and your partner. \n\nYou're breastfeeding and running a household, that's an enormous amount of work and it's a 24/7 job. Feeling like you're a failure or losing yourself is normal, it happens to us all but it's not a part of motherhood that's openly discussed. I do worry about you mentioning frequent breakdowns. Have you been screened for post partum depression or anxiety? Your OBGYN should be able to help. \n\nFor practical advice, find a schedule that works for you and stick to it. I mean for everything. Make a couple of hours a week after the baby is in bed for you and your husband. Take some you time. Even if its getting up fifteen minutes earlier to enjoy a cup of coffee alone. Those alone minutes can be the difference between staying calm and losing your shit entirely. If you're able, hire a babysitter one night a month for a date with hubby. Remember it's okay to ask for help. I waited until my youngest was three to hire a nanny and she's a godsend. Her creativity and input is well worth every penny I've spent and she's become an invaluable part of our family. \n\nAnd finally, this to shall pass. All of the struggles you have are temporary and you'll be okay. Your baby will be okay if you're not perfect and so will hubby. Don't compare yourself to other moms or families. You're doing great. \n\nAlso, it's totally okay to hide in the bathroom and cry for a minute when it's overwhelming.",

My husband took nights on the weekends (Friday and Saturday night) so I could actually sleep.  Do you absolutely have to keep pumping? Can you supplement with formula? \n\nYou really need some self care.  There is nothing that says you never get a break just because you are a mom of a baby. In fact you really, really need a break.  Theres nothing wrong with that.  I realize theres a quarantine on and I dont know where you are - but even if you can go get a coffee and sit in the car with a book for 30 minutes.  \n\nThe thing is you have a ton of things going on here: you have an infant you is still at an age that is fully dependent on you.  You probably arent sleeping amazing. You are isolated because of a quarantine (along with the stress of that). You are essentially doing this alone (with some help from your husband).  \n\nThe infant is a full time job that never ends.  The house and being a homemaker is a full time job.  There isnt much time for leisure and building up your empty stores (you cannot pour from an empty cup).  Figure out what you need.  One day a week of sleeping in?  3 evenings where you can take a bath? Going out to get coffee? Calling a friend?  I cant answer the question for you.  But what you ARE doing isnt working.  Be specific and then tell your husband I really need sleep and I need one full night of sleep a week.  How can we make that happen? Or whatever it is that you need.  YOU ARE NOT A BAD MOM FOR NEEDING THIS nor are you a bad wife.  You, my dear, are human.  \n\nIf after replenishing your stores you still dont like things that you used to enjoy - please talk to your doctor about it.  You could have Post Partum Depression.  \n\nA couple of books I really like : Replenish by Lisa Byrne \n\nSay Goodbye to Survival Mode by Crystal Paine\n\nThe transition into motherhood is a hard one.  I feel like as a society its supposed to be this 6 week - all the weight is gone, baby is sleeping all night.  Its okay that you arent okay right now.\n\nEdit-cant believe I forgot this! My advice to all new moms (especially if you are struggling!) is to get outside as much as you can.  I realize it may be hard.  But if you can put baby in a stroller or a carrier and got for a short walk that can make a world of difference.  Even just sitting on the porch or a park bench can be very refreshing instead of being stuck inside all day.",

I put the children to bed and I do my best to relax/spend time with my husband. I would start adjusting baby's schedule and yours to align with your husband's. Can you put the child in your room to make things easier? Feed the baby and everyone goes back to sleep. \n\nPumping while breastfeeding is quite unpleasant. When I did it, I wanted to just give formula. I would stop pumping unless someone needs to watch your LO while you're away. Has baby started solids? That would be beneficial to you. I loved those yogurt melts for my son. Look into baby-led weaning, so that you don't have to sit there and fight him with a spoon. \n\n7.5+ months is a perfect time to start playdates. Even if you're the parent hosting or watching the children, you can go somewhere like a child friendly coffee house or park to escape. Children love playing outside, on playgrounds, and with toys they don't have at home, even if they go to see those specific toys weekly. Getting out of the house in general is helpful for one's sanity. \n\nAs far as housework goes. Declutter and minimize possessions! Best thing I've done. I have yet to organize and strategically place everything, but I can totally see how that will only improve our lifestyle at home and cleanliness/tidiness. Ask for help. If you can afford even 1 hour of help a week, it would be worth it. Get into a routine and schedule. With good habits you can do such things as unloading the dishwasher in the few minutes that it takes to make your coffee. Don't be afraid to let your son watch a bit of TV. When he is older, give him chores and tasks to help! \n\nI agree with the other commenter, as well. You must discuss this with your husband. At the very least he should be respecting your desire to go to sleep earlier. I, personally, find it quite difficult to sleep without mine in the bed with me. Now, his computer is in our bedroom, so the lights and sounds from gaming make it challenging to sleep. If he's up late, so am I.",

Social niceties and sounding open/warm drain me a lot, because my character tends to be more calm, straightforward and logical, even serious.

How can I present myself as warm in a conversation, without having to act bubbly? (I do feel warm and open to listening, Im just not sure that Im coming off that way!). I also have a very low threshold for bullshit, and many times conversations seem to involve white lies, feigned interest, bullshitting, which make it tiring.

When you're talking to someone, always think about their emotions first more than whatever it is you're trying to convey. I think that'll do it. I'm not entirely sure.

Im not talking about someone who provides good mental stimulation or debates with you.

Its not to be interesting or funny or the center of attention. Its to make whoever you are speaking to feel comfortable and special.\n\nTo be a great conversationalist, you have to shift your focus from your inner thoughts to others outward feelings. Doing so isnt easy and takes some practice, but its absolutely a skill you can develop. \n\nAs another person suggested, the YouTube channel Charisma on Command is EXCELLENT. It helped me hone a lot of the little skills that add up to being a better conversationalist. \n\nI would specifically recommend the video on Dwayne Johnson.

My father trained the rabbi who gave his service. My husbands students carried his coffin. Ive gotten so many letters and phone calls just sharing what my father and husband did for the people of our community. I never realized what sort of pillars in the community they were . \n\nMy father was a rabbi for 40 years so the number of weddings, funeral, bris, mitzvahs is probably uncountable. The time he spent counseling is immeasurable. Theres probably no way to measure my fathers impact. \n\nMy husband ran a book store and taught at the Yeshiva and was super active in the community. My husband was always there when someone needed him and gave deeply and frequently. \n\nThats what I want my children to know their father and grandfather as. Caring and giving people who made the world better.\n\nIm slowly getting used to a new normal without my husband. My whole routine is shifted without him. Im trying to keep things as normal as possible for the kids. Ive been trying to keep for crying in front of them. But I keep breaking down. Im not strong and this hard and terrifying and painful.

We were in the dating phase for around 3 months before he asked me if I was interested in becoming a couple (relationship). I was initially surprised since I felt it was a bit soon for me, but I did (do) like him a lot and thought why not give it a shot and see what happens.\n\nI feel that our chemistry has been very similar to the dating phase to the relationship phase, other than the fact we are dealing with lockdowns right now (like most people around the world). I like him a lot! I really do. But, I have noticed over the last month or so of talking with me, he brings up a lot of interesting topics around me. Last weekend when we were together, we ended up having this conversation where he was saying; *You were riding the cock carousel before you met me.* - things like that.\n\nI did figure out in the dating phase that he liked the YouTuber, Entrepreneurs in Cars, since we talked about a couple of videos that Rich Cooper posted (he likes him). One of the reasons I like my boyfriend a lot is because I feel we can talk about pretty much anything and have good discussions. Im always trying to be the feminine addition to his life and compliment him on his journey. However, I dont like him accusing me of things like riding the cock carousel, or even when he mentioned me possibly monkey branching on him for another guy.\n\nThe last few times these comments have come up, it has bothered me quite a bit because I like him a ton. I dont like him accusing me of things that are not true (i.e. I havent rode the CC). Im looking for advice on how to approach this topic if/when it comes up again. For some reason, I feel like it will come up again at a later date and I would like to shut it down completely. Any thoughts or advice on my situation would be greatly appreciated!\n\nThank you!",

This is why psychopaths are attractive, bad boys, the best at sport, celebrities, confident frame-controller, etc.\n\nMen do not start at the top of the dominance hierarchy, they work for it.\nUnlike the past, men have a good chance at getting there without being murdered or put in their place by those already at the top.

Not manipulation, but simply being feminine brings out qualities for a man. Win-win.\n\nIf he is to be this level of attractive to you, he will get the attention of other women.

Win-lose in short term maybe, lose-lose in long term definitely \n\nAnd on and on, there is no ideal for you, no perfect situation without a compromise.\n\n*Conclusion*: figure out what you want to compromise, to sacrifice, and what you value most. What is the ideal situation, what is the ideal man? Do you have the red pill knowledge to simulate the potential downfalls and to figure out if that ideal situation is realistic.\n\nMake your goal specific in that way.\nFigure out if it is realistic, and achievable.",

We have been dating for two years.\nI have been lurking the sub for awhile now and just recently (~4 months I'd say) switched my wardrobe from jeans, crop tops, and sneakers, to more feminine clothing such as dresses, heels, jewelry etc. This style change has made me instantly more confident and in tune with my femininity. I never thought I'd love dresses this much!\n\nHowever, I'm having a problem with how my boyfriend has reacted to these changes. It's not like he is telling me what and what not to wear - he says he likes me in everything. However, I've been having some self-esteem issues when it comes to his reactions.\nWhenever I wear tight leggings or jeans (I will every once in awhile now), he goes crazy over it and talks about how good/sexy I look. But I've noticed that when I wear my dresses that make me feel beautiful/feminine, he rarely ever comments. This is confusing me because here on RPW I keep reading that high value men appreciate a modestly dressed feminine woman, but I get wayyy more of a reaction from my bf when I'm at my least confident clothing-wise (jeans/leggings).\n\nHonestly, it makes me pretty sad. For instance, I came to his house the other day wearing my hair in a messy bun, leggings, a tanktop and a jean jacket, and he said \"Wow, you look like you took a few extra minutes to get ready this morning\" and I was instantly confused? Then when I wear a long, flowy dress and my hair down and makeup done CRICKETS  It's driving me insane!\nNot sure what's going on here and I would love some insight! Thank you RPW!",

It clearly talks about how her husband can hold an esteemed position because she is truly his helper, she supports him so he can function at a higher level.  Wow, I would love to have this type of support!\nCan men abuse their authority? Definitely.  Can women be just as abusive like that or in other ways?  Definitely.

I am familiar with this disagreement. We've made progress, though. \n\n> I really feel dismissed and I feel like he's prioritizing his desires over mine.\n\nFirst, it's irrelevant who makes more money, if you're not keeping your income separate. I make 20k more than my husband and I don't get to use that in arguments.\n\nSecond, it feels like he's prioritizing his wants over yours, because it's true. He wants what he wants, not what you want and it's as simple as that. I highly doubt he sees this as a sign of disregard or dismissal. He just wants some blinds and you already have a table. \n\nIf you want to make progress on this issue, particularly if it's recurring and not just this one thing, you need to *calmly* explain how this makes you feel. This was his ex's table and you don't like it and have been wanting to replace it for years, to his refusal, and now you especially don't want to take it to a new house. You clearly have the expendable income and you've wanted to replace the table for longer than he's wanted blinds. You'd really like to get the table and make blinds the next big purchase. Perhaps you can sell the current table and put that money toward it. I also think it's worth mentioning that his response came off as really dismissive. \n\nThe key here is to politely refuse to go pick up the blinds before talking about it, so you don't just end up with new blinds. Then calmly tell him how you feel without assuming he intended any of it. Then work together to reach a compromise. If you can't get the table now, because there's some reason the blinds must come first, then when can you? Can you start setting money aside with his blessing?",

I'm a nurse, and the transition was stressful, and the shifts were long and the mornings were dark, early, damp, and cold. There was a woman who would ride the same bus at the same time as me, and although we never exchanged a word, she has made a lasting impact on me, and I find myself thinking of her often. I wanted to share my experience with you ladies. \n\nThis woman was an average woman, likely in her 50s, with a rather plain face, plain clothes, and sometimes rather disheveled. She often sat across from me, with muddy rain boots, and hair slightly askew from wind and rain. Every other person on the bus was either sleeping, or on their phone, scowling, irritable, and cold. \n\nBut this woman wore a smile. Her expression was always soft, inviting, friendly, and she had a peaceful presence about her that was mesmerizing and downright fascinating. She was beautiful, warm, and kind. She never looked impatient, she never scowled down at a phone screen, she would not look away when I met her gaze but would smile sweetly at me, and I would smile back. We shared these rides together in silence, and I found myself smiling too. I would look out the window as the first traces of light came up through the treetops, and I would find stillness in an otherwise stressful commute. \n\nThen, as weeks passed, I noticed a shift in my own behavior. I noticed myself smiling at work, among coworkers who were stressed, anxious, and exhausted. I noticed that I could make the people around me laugh, and smile too, and maybe even complain less. My patients seemed to smile more as well,  despite their suffering and fear. I noticed that I would catch myself smiling while standing in line at the grocery store, or while doing the dishes, or weeding. I would smile in the car, when going on rides with my partner.\n\nAnd as the world has changed through this pandemic, as people have begun social distancing, and fearing not only the virus but one another, smiles have seemed to disappear altogether, mask or no mask. \n\nWhether you cover your face or not, smile more. Smile for yourself, smile with your eyes. It will change your life, it might change someone else's. It is feminine, it is gentle, it is kind. It seems we need more of that these days than ever.",

I am not masculine or alpha or aggressive at all, but I have had relationships break down because I didnt make my partners feel needed. Both of my two big breakups were with men in respectable, but not high-powered, careers whod been excited about me because I had a real job. Both breakups happened because they said they felt like I did not need them, and I am trying to figure out if it was due to something that I did wrong or if egos had played a role. If I need to play down aspects of myself or if Id just been with very insecure people. \n\n\nI do not brag about my schooling or my job or anything like that EVER. It is a lesson that has been voiced to me by many of my female mentors and I am well aware that men do not care much about womens accomplishments, Ivy League pedigree, or professional prowess. If anything, I downplay my career (currently a resident) and background. But the fact of the matter is that I have always worked hard, gone to top schools, and stayed on track. I am not a hardened, un-feminine career woman but I am simply driven by what I do (specialty derm) and am good at it. And I feel like I am being penalized for having high income potential on top of it all. After my most recent ex found out that I would be averaging $500k in a few years, he started picking fights and always making me out to be the villain, and I know Im not imagining it. It ultimately ended with the explanation of you dont need me, youll find someone better and leave. Maybe he was letting me down easy but I myself know that I am attractive. My work ethic translates to my physical upkeep, and I have improved my looks since we began dating, if anything.\n\n\nI know that a lot of it has to do with him not feeling like a hero, but I really did try to make sure he felt needed. Its just that I dont really need any saving. I want a partner, and it seems like that is too much to ask. Has anyone else been in this situation?",

            "body": "Why I love my husband[Why I love my husband ](https://imgur.com/a/SYPeeAC)\n\nHe leads me in the Faith- he had a proven track record *before* I met him.\n\nBefore I met him; My husband he was active in ministry in his previous church. Once that church had dispensed he has committed to attending another church weekly. He has always given faithfully to the church and has supported various missions. He is also sponsoring a child.\n\nAfter I met him; His commitments did not change. Since before we were engaged he brought me along to his church and introduced me to his church family. He has supported me in supporting the missions I am involved in financially and also agreed with my request for us to contribute more to the church. He has continued sponsoring a child (which he did not advertise to me, but I noticed when I saw a letter from world vision).\n\nNow we are married; We attend church weekly together. Every night in bed he reads his bible next to me before we sleep. He also has a YouTube channel where he creates sermon jams. \n\nHe has never over promised or broken a promise.\n\nThe first time I met my husband he kissed me on the cheek and opened the car door for me, the door swung back and closed, but by that time he was half way around the car. He cringed hard and tried to brush it off. \n\nFrom that first meeting forward he always opened my car door when coming to pick me up and closed it behind me. I would always giggle and insist he never had to do that and it was ridiculous to keep up, but on this occasion and on many he said Ill never do anything for you that I cant keep up. And it was true. \n\nHe never over promised, he never over extended, he never spoilt me to woo me in the beginning then became tight later on. His spending, his actions towards me and his love for me never spiked then fell. He opened up the car door for me until we got married and started living together, so I open up my car door now (partly on my insistence, haha). After becoming ill and battling chronic illness, he started opening the door for me again when I was too weak. This is a small example of how he has stayed consistent.\n\nHe doesnt lie to me- he tells me what he likes and gives me the means to submit to his preferences.\n\nI always used to joke with my husband why dont you just lie to me?! I dont want to know!  When he told me things I did not want to hear. I was joking, partly, as my sinfulness wanted an easy life and a man that told me what I wanted.\n\nWell, through Gods grace to me, Im married to a man that is so honest to me, sometimes it is confrontational. He doesnt like above the knee jean shorts, he thinks theyre hideous. He doesnt like t-shirt dresses, he thinks theyre equally hideous (two things I wore often), he doesnt like long skirts on me, he doesnt like short hair etc...etc... it might sound picky, but its directional and in going against what hes said, that would be the true confrontation. It is unloving to do something you know your partner does not like.\n\nMy husband spoke to me and suggested we go shopping. He encouraged me to dress like some of the girls my age and that how they dress would suit me a lot (can you imagine hearing this without a humble heart?) but he has never brought something up without his support and means to fix the issue. So, he takes me shopping. Wow, look at my hot fianc! (We were engaged at the time) it made me feel admired and loved, it was amazing to see his reaction and how happy he was every time I skipped out to his car wearing the clothes he bought me. In saying that, we didnt buy anything I wasnt comfortable in, a few pairs of jeans, white sneakers, multiple t shirts of the same colour- so simple but he loved it, and I loved him even more for telling me. Ive bought many husband approved dresses since, which he adores.\n\n\nHe has clear standards for me. He introduced me to his friends, family and church. \n\nIn his vetting process of me, he let me have his real personality from the beginning. He made things clear how he liked it and as we interacted with other couples, we saw real life examples of how we would and wouldnt want to be like. \n\nCouple A- My husband is friends with the husband. He cant stand the wife. Shes overweight, unkind and screams at her husband in public. My hubby was very clear at his distain for her and never pretended to like her even in front of her. He was blunt and didnt go out of his way to acknowledge her. It was clear he did not respect her. I never wanted that to be me.\n\nCouple B- My husband did ministry for a long time with the husband of this couple. His wife was sweet, feminine and absolutely lovely. She was kind and warm to me when I was an outsider in the group. She was respectful of her husband and it showed in everything they did together. She was thin and dressed well. My husband enjoyed our time a lot with this couple and told me how much he respected their relationship. He would say things like theyre the real deal I think its amazing shes kept in shape so well after having a child \n\nBy this feedback, and seeing how he treated these different types of people, and on top of that, knowing how consistent he is as a person, I knew how not to act. \n\nHis health/ my health \n\nHe has made it clear that cooking at home needs to be healthy. My husband goes to the gym 5-6 days a week and eats the same thing for lunch everyday. I would push him sometimes for him to let me prepare him lunch, but he insistent that is what he will eat everyday and it is what is best for his health. \n\nWe go shopping together and buy the food I will cook together. I buy ingredients he likes and ingredients that are healthy. He has told me he wants veggies in his diet, so thats what I cook. He wants high protein meals, so thats what I cook. I make sure I have the ingredients for all the meals he could want (to a point) so he has the freedom to ask for what he wants for dinner.  \n\nHe has made what he wants clear. He does not allow us to eat take away more than once a week. He is hyper aware of his body (I always catch him tensing in front of the mirror, haha) and is hyper aware of my body. Hes made it clear he does not want me to gain any weight and that the weight I am right now is the largest he would like me (Im 58kg, 54) he has also found the most hilarious way to let me know Im gaining weight  wow honey, look how big your breasts are! Makes me laugh thinking about it. With his help, Ive stayed pretty much the same weight since meeting him. Him being honest about his absolute disgust for fat people has helped- and its a mutual thing. I wouldnt ever let him gain weight and I have his support back.\n\n\nHe takes care of me and brings me security \n\nFinancial security; My husband sought to get a stable job and savings before he put himself on the market to be married. By the time I met him, he had a deposit saved for a house and a job that was recession proof. He made it clear to me that is getting a house together would require me working full time until we were ready for kids. He told me it would be difficult and that he would support me in this. \n\nGod provided me a job that is close to home and my husband drives me every morning. (Currently not working due to COVID)\n\nHealth; during our engagement I had a trip to the ER. It turned out I had a cyst on my ovary, we did not realise the health hurdles we would be tackling in the next year and a half because of it. 5 more trips to the ER, specialist and doctors appointments, IUD insertions and a surgery later, Im still on the mend and take pain killers to manage in the meantime. This is a chronic condition called endometriosis. I never, ever expected my husband to be so supportive and unconditionally loyal. \n\nI remember on one trip to the hospital I was passing out in the passengers seat and vomiting. In my moments of consciousness I looked to my husband and he kept saying dont worry baby, we are almost there, its going to be ok.\n\nI trusted him and let the anxiety go. Its a blurr but I ended up in a hospital bed getting emergency pain relief. He waited with me in the hospital the entire day. This happened quiet a few more times. After my operation I went back to the ER and we waited in the horrible waiting room chairs for 8 hours through the early hours of the morning. Everytime I looked at him I wanted to cry out of gratitude, I felt so horrid and he was right there with me. I can not believe the level of empathy and maturity he has shown to me when I was in 10/10 pain.\n\nIn my moments of absolute weakness and exhaustion, so much so I couldnt cry out to God, he would put his hand on me and pray for me.\n\nHe puts me first before his family.\n\nWe come from a traditional culture where the mothers tend to baby their sons. I love my MIL to death and I dont mind her asking questions, but my husband without hesitation always shuts everyone down if they question how I am at home. \n\nDoes Anna cook for you everyday? He will respond along the lines of why does it matter? She can do as she likes shes the cook of the home. \n\nOh, poor Anna, she cant speak our language he will respond what do you mean poor Anna? Shes a lion. You should be the one learning English.\n\nHe will shut down any conversation that is not kind to me, he does not complain about me to his family nor friends. He will not let his friends joke about our sex life.\n\nHe does not let me overextend myself for the sake of his family even though I am extremely willing to. He tells me and has the strong belief that our immediate family unit (him and me) are most important and everything else is secondary. We of course love his family a lot, especially his parents, but hes made it clear we wont partake in anything just for the sake of tradition. \n\nBonus points:\n\n-He gets along amazingly with my Dad, we all hang out all the time and its the best part of my life! \n\n-His family love me (they joke constantly they love me more than they love him!)\n \n-He is good with children and loves his nephews, we even baby set sometimes.\n\n-He grew his beard for me.",

This sounds so silly now, but I guess me asking him if he still wants something doesn't communicate how I feel about it. He can't look after my needs properly if I don't tell him how I feel. We're resuming the intimacy as we're both on the same page about what's safe for us, problem solved!)**\n\nMy boyfriend and I have been together for \\~9 months, and we love each other. The last time we saw each other \"normally\" before things got serious in our state (e.g. lockdowns began) was in mid-March. Since then, I have been at his place one time (toward the end of March) because he lives with his father at the moment, and they both have been vigilant about not allowing anybody else at the house. Both of them have been able to return to work safely as of the second week of May. We're still seeing each other on the weekends, like clockwork -- just in my part of town, or at an outdoor midpoint we can both get to such as a state park. And fortunately, no one in either of our social circles has tested positive, and neither have we.\n\nThe main struggle I'm having is this: Since mid-March, at his request, we have not kissed on the lips/made out. Our intimacy has not gone past hugging or cuddling, and even then it's not prolonged. Keep in mind, we had not gone past making out ever in our relationship, mainly because both of us have been moving slowly for our own reasons. I am big on giving and receiving physical touch, particularly through physical intimacy, so to have this part of our relationship almost disappear for two months has been really hard for me. I know he's having a hard time too for the same reason, but every time I've asked him what he thinks, he's stated that he doesn't like having this boundary, but he hasn't changed his mind.\n\nMy question is: I've never once nagged him or tried to manipulate him into changing his mind about this. I know he's just using his judgment to try and keep me safe, since he's told me that he's more worried about spreading the virus to me (his county has way more cases than mine). I've known him for almost a year before we got together, and I do trust him: He's not abusive or controlling or on some power trip by shutting kissing down. And I know that once things calm down, and he feels we're both safe enough, our physical intimacy will come back with a fury. **But I've never been in a healthy LTR for this long. So I've never really had a relationship before where I have to trust a man unconditionally with a temporary change that (1) I'm chafing against like crazy, and (2) don't how long I'll have to go along with. This, I think, is the root of the issue. As a RPW, what should I do?**",

I realised that I have been treating my boyfriend like my husband - what should I do about this?\n\n We've been together for 2 years (the first year was on and off and this year has been stable). Yesterday night we were talking on the phone and I joked saying I like the nick name Bubby because its hubby and baby mixed into one. We have been discussing marriage alot since being in Quarantine so I guess I felt comfortable making that joke. Then he said laughing that it was too soon and I shouldn't call him that. That shut me down - it made me realise I have been giving myself to someone as if he were my husband when he doesn't see himself that way or me like his wife. He is a good guy. He is loving and I would like to marry him some day. He said that however and I pretty much hung up and now I have this innate unease when I think about him. \n\nI know it is not his fault but I think I am more annoyed with myself for getting carried away - I am 20 and he is my first boyfriend so I can see why I fell into this pit of fantasy. When he said that it burst my bubble... I've lost my sexual attraction to him - me and him aren't really tied in any way so why should I give myself? We have treated sex casually in the relationship but I have been moving towards Chastity for a while now so because we are distanced due to this quarantine I have been turning him down for sexting and so on. I dont like sex being so casual anymore? But I was okay with it before? I cant help but see him as a user - even though that's not what is going on... I dont want to see him or have him touch me rn? I know I am being over dramatic. \n\nSo...\n\nWhat are husband benefits?\n\nWhat are boyfriend benefits? \n\nShould I learn to compartmentalise the two? \n\nWhat are your experiences? \n\nHow do I make it clear that wifey is something to be earned and that I am no longer going to be the way I was before?\n\nThank you so much sisters ",

It is unlikely that he is dating you with marriage in mind. \n\nI was a couple of years older than you when I met my husband, who was in his late 20s at the time. We were both dating for marriage and moved in together after only 6 months and were engaged in less than a year and married less than a year after that. \n\nVery, very little has changed from the time we started living together and now as far as how we act. There is very little distinction between girlfriend and wife. For most women, the only distinction is allowing the government into your relationship through legal marriage. For some women, it may also mean engaging in physical activity outside of hand holding and side hugs. \n\nHere, I think the real issue is that your SO is not old enough to truly be prepared for marriage. At your age, relationships tend to take much longer before marriage.  Among my husbands friends, those who met their partners in their early 20s took nearly a decade to propose. In contrast, those who met in their partners in their late 20s and early 30s were ready to commit to marriage in 6-12 months.",

Also are you withholding sex because you feel like it will give you more power or an upper hand the the relationship?

That being said, he is under no obligation to go along with it and probably won't. You might need to start considering if this is actually the right relationship for you.\n\nAside from that, husband benefits is an interesting topic. We usually only talk about wife benefits. I would say the following are singular to a husband:\n\nFor better or for worse: This pandemic has been really rough on me, on the heels of some other life altering stress. I've not handled it well. Vetting is over, though. We're married and my husband takes that seriously and has been my rock through my stress and tears and paranoia. I have been a *chore* of a wife at times, this year. I would never expect a boyfriend to put up with that.\n\nFor richer or for poorer: As your husband, his money is likely yours. Before marriage, anything he buys for you is a gift. Don't forget it and *never* ask for financial help. I actually have a rather long anecdote about my husband thinking I was about to ask for money when we were dating, when it was the furthest thing from my mind. It would have seriously dampened the relationship and he would have refused.\n\nIn sickness and in health: It's perfectly acceptable for him to bring you soup when you're sick or hang out with you and watch movie, but he isn't obligated to care for your physical well-being like he would were you married. When I nearly cut off my thumb last year, my husband took off work, rescheduled his call shift, picked me up as my emergency contact, drove me across the city to get stitched up under worker's comp, and stopped to get Chinese food on the way home for me. That is pretty above and beyond and while it would be nice of a boyfriend to do it, I'm not sure it's fair to expect it. The same goes for running out to get medicine or cleaning out the trashcan after you've thrown up.\n\nThe mundane: Sharing household chores and responsibilities and daily routines really muddies the water and it's why I caution cohabitation. My husband is in this for life, so cleaning my hair out if the drain is part of that, as are all the other gross parts of living with humans and the pets we share. I would never expect a boyfriend to take responsibility for trimming the dogs' nails, putting up the Christmas lights, chopping up the Christmas tree for firewood, or getting our oil changed. Those are husband tasks, as are the many little chores we've decided to split between ourselves.",

            "body": "The Riot TR boards post referenced in this reddit post makes it clear that the issue with the lolskin software is that it enables player to use Riot skins that you normally pay for, for free.\n\nThis practice is called \"skin hacking\" or \"skin porting\" and is unanimously rejected by the modern custom skin community. At least, it is the case for VoXskins, the community I'm a part of.\n\nThe problem didn't ever stem from the ability to use custom, fan-made skins. Custom skins are something that Rioters actually find pretty cool, and modders are usually very involved players. There's always been a gray area and a tolerance towards us, and it is clear that custom skins haven't ever been a legitimate ban reason.\n\nAny person that was banned because they used custom skins were banned because they installed their mods through a software that was bundled with other unfair features. This was the case with MKLoL / MKJogo, which added an unfair advantage through jungle timers (didn't exist in game at all back then). This is also the case with LoLskin: it isn't an unfair advantage but that software hurts Riot's business strongly by jeopardizing their main source of income. The widespread use of LoLskin is what pushed Riot to decide to make it bannable.\n\nNowadays, custom skins can be installed using clean software that was developed by members of the custom skins community, that aren't bundled with any features that could pose a problem with Riot's business or give an unfair advantage. The community closely pays attention to what is distributed so that we remain in the best terms with Riot possible.\n\nTL;DR lolskin is bannable because it gave you free skins client-side, not because of custom skins",

This is a story about a guy who sets up and executes a threesome, which is different than most of what is posted. \n\nBody\n\n>Good seduction competently follows Mysterys attraction, comfort, escalation model and so lay reports tend to get repetitious. Im much more interested in the principles of game that you can use repeatedly to get ongoing results than any one particular story.\n\n>Knowing the underlying principles means you can get repeat results. Recently I pulled together a threesome with my main girl and a new one I met, and taking RPDs excellent advice I wanted to write this lay report to crystallize for myself what I did right while my thoughts are fresh. I intend to do more of these in the future.\n\nThere are a number of takeaways\n\n>Set the frame from the first time you meet a girl that youre a sexual, non-judgmental guy. Plant the seed with women you date as part of your sexual dirty talk that a threesome would be fun for you and her to enjoy together.\n\n>When pitching the actual threesome date to a girl you dont know well, be indirect. Instead just suggest another friend joins for a drink or that you hang out at your place. Give girls plausible deniability.\n\n>Threesomes take even stronger leading than a normal 1:1 date. You as the man have to lead the girls through the entire process.\n\nConclusion\n\nThreesomes are fun but tricky. \n\nHow this benefits the community\n\nMost guys want threesomes but never get them. This is a story about a guy who sets up and executes a threesome, which is different than most of what is posted. If you are a guy and you want a threesome, then this is a guide to help you make that happen.

            "body": "[Repost] Unattainbles - A Core Element of Masculinity**tl;dr  won't usually do this for you, but this one is easy**\n\nSimply put: In order for a man to be happy and at peace, he must have a presently unattainable goal.\n\n\n------\n\n\nLet's jump right into it. Your personal deficiencies are going to be very different from the other guy (and your past self as you grow up and evolve). To expound on the second point, what I cared about at 17 was of the utmost importance to me at 17, but has no relevance to me now. Likewise, my expectation of achieving the goals I set for present-day me would be outrageous at that time.\n\nThat means in plain English that my mission in life at 17 was as follows:\n\n* Graduate high school\n* Hold on to the relationship with my girlfriend\n\nMy unattainable at 17 was:\n\n* Get into my \"dream\" college  \n\nWhen the unattainable is achieved, something new must take its place. **Failure to do this creates existential agony until an appropriate obstacle is in place to calm that nerve once again**. What do I do now when I achieve what felt like the unattainable? I invent a new unattainable. However, this lesson took some time to learn.\n\nMy college mission was as follows:\n\n* Break up with high school girlfriend\n* Make grades\n* Rush the fraternity I wanted to be in\n\nMy unattainable at the time was as follows:\n\n\n* \n\n\nYep, nothing. This is where my journey stalled. I never bothered to think past my last unattainable into a new one! After all, I had already done the impossible. I was perfect and needed no further improvement in my mind.\n\nI briefly got back together with the high school girlfriend long distance. It was, as my football coach put it, an \"other than positive experience\". See the problem?\n\n----\n\nThis applies to men of literally any age. I use a teenage example because it will resonate with boys and men alike, but the message is the same: whether your limitations are sex, money, power, wealth (believe me, that is different than money), or fame (a thing many people hamster into attaining the other 4 aforementioned), you need to understand that without some seemingly unattainable goal to strive for you will never continue to be a man.\n\n\nThe core act of being a man involves becoming a different man worthy of surpassing self-defined milestones. The unattainable should be a combination of \"a thing you've never done before and have limited hope of achieving RIGHT NOW\" and \"things men you admire and respect have done before\". \n\nFortunately for our dear readers, many are probably major losers right now. This unattainable can be as low as \"kiss a new girl\" or \"earn a promotion / earn $46,575 a year\". THIS IS A GOOD THING. Your self-actualization depends on actually achieving these goals, *just not in your current mindset, body, or frame.*\n\nFor the avoidance of confusion, your current mission should be:\n\n1. Specific\n2. Measurable\n3. Attainable\n4. Relevant \n5. Timely\n\nYour current unattainable may or may not be any of these things - you have the freedom to decide. The only requirement is that the unattainable must be grand enough that you are currently unworthy. Hold yourself to this principle, and you will evolve rapidly into the man you want to be.",

The anima is all the subconscious feminine impulses of the masculine mind, while the animus the all the subconscious masculine impulses of the feminine mind. They are best thought of as yin and yang. When \"possession\" happens, it refers to a takeover of the dominating part by the lesser part. Chaos ensues. \n\n____\n\nMy friend is married with two very young children. He is a textbook extrovert. He had an active bachelor life, never a problem getting women. He wasn't RP, he just did MANY RP things without realizing it. He has an almost magical ability to get people to follow him and subscribe to his ideas. He lies very easily and convincingly. He has the dark triad down pat. Since childhood, he has created a number of memes (Dawkins definition, not internet definition) within our friends group that stuck for months. On top of that, he rakes in a comfortable six-figure salary in the finance field.\n\nBut the curious thing about this man, who I consider a brother, is that he's never wanted to be a leader. The thought turns him off. And he has always gone for women he could be submissive with. \"Alpha in the streets, beta in the sheets,\" doesn't quite describe it. More like beta in the house as soon as he steps through the door.\n\nHis wife comes from money. Big family, not divorced. She is, for the purpose of this discussion, otherwise a typical woman. A little more neurotic than most, but typical nonetheless. She took a high turnover job that she was doing when they met. She stopped doing that job because it was \"stressful\" (and really it is, but c'mon, could you imagine quitting), and stayed home to take care of the kids. But her quitting predates the pregnancy.\n\n____\n\nLat year my friend had a tragedy in his family, the kind that will weaken any man. Most women will allow you to be weak for 1, maybe 2 days. But in him this persisted. And eventually he displayed the **ultimate form of weakness**: he considered suicide. Even worse, he told her. \n\nSo she did what women do and dragged him to a couples therapist where most of the time was spent with her berating and \"venting\" about him. And, he tells me, they would always come back from therapy seemingly worse than when they began. This is a stereotype that I think we've heard about  a lot. I was very disheartened to see it play out so clearly, so close to home. And I'm not even kidding, you could have scripted it. Really saddening stuff.\n\nSo of course she did what any woman does when she sees her man hit rock bottom for a prolonged period of time. She supported him throughout in a very nurturing way and built him back up. \n\nHa. Come on. \n\nNo, she kicked him out. He is now simply waiting for the other shoe to drop. \n\n___\n\nSo what I'm seeing is possession on both sides. She is the one making all the decisions and she has simply switched off to him. There is no getting through to her. She has somehow turned his thoughts of self harm against him and made it about her. You know what I'm talking about. When a girl gets to that point, becomes that brick wall. She becomes a stranger. It's a terrifying thing to go through if you've never seen it before. That's her animus possession.\n\nAnd he, he is reduced to begging. He wants to \"fight\" for her. He is purely following his emotions. He is talking too much. He is a shadow of who he was, taking a one-two punch of his family tragedy early, and now this new tragedy. His anima is in charge.\n\n___\n\nUnderlying this is a jarring reality: I have looked up to this man my whole life. I have mimicked and copied some of the things he does as an example, with some really good success. This is a guy who has made the right moves since day 1. While I was fucking around with my head in the clouds, making mistake after mistake, he always -almost naturally- knew the right thing to do.\n\nNow I am worried about him. I am worried about losing my brother. And he has already been seeing therapists all year, both on his own and the couple. I think I might be the only one on his side, because I know that despite all his genius he has never been here before and doesn't know what to do. And that's why he is making the wrong moves. If I didn't now what I know, my reaction would also be to distance myself because no one likes a downer. But I know everyone else is doing that. \n\nAfter the shoe does drop, I'm going to try to guide him correctly. But I've only ever rescued myself from the anima before. It took months, almost a year. I just need him to not fucking kill himself.",

The problem with any forum on masculinity is that it inevitably gets filled with unmasculine men who have their own theories on masculinity. Unavoidably the forum starts catering down to what the beta males already do and therefore want to hear. In other words, reductive power point style lists, conduct manuals, and explanations on why their current behavior is okay. What they desperately want to believe is that the behavior that they are forced to exhibit in their heavily taxed 9-5 corpo cuck job will magically get them laid, even though its not and is actually pulling them down into a soul draining spiral of depression.\n\nSexual Selection is a means by which females chose exciting new phenotypes for the next generation. Females want the fastest antelope, the loudest songbird and the most obnoxious douchebag. They want the male who has what others don't and can thus disrupt the status quo. Beta Males are the status quo which is why their whole strategy is imitation. If you are using pickup lines you are by definition a beta male as you are sexually reliant on imitating the mating strategies of other males. You have admitted to yourself that you are uninteresting, incapable of becoming interesting and need to fool women into believing you are something that you are not. Alpha males win the race. Beta males buy trophies so they can trick people and themselves into thinking they won the race. If you are interested in seeing this latter behavior first hand, head over to the seduction subreddit. But I must warn you they are complete and utter fags.\n\nNext we should answer the question: When and why is it necessary to AMOG aka establish social dominance? First and foremost, we need a clear definition of what a beta male is. A beta male is a mushy turd that takes the shape of his immediate surroundings. Beta males prefer comfort over abstract freedom. They enjoy the warmth and security of the herd and spent their youth being molded into the perfect worker drone consumer by media and education system. They're comfortable with how things are and dislike change. Therefore if you are pushing for change or advocating for something that is different from the norm you must first break the will of the beta males so they stop clucking and shut the fuck up. Obviously the big picture of what you're trying to accomplish will remain a complete mystery to beta males because they are pragmatards who don't think top down or think in terms of potentiality. In other words, whenever you try to accomplish anything big you will be called an asshole, crazy or dismissed with an all-inclusive meaningless label. That's okay. No one accomplished anything meaningful without being hated on in the process, just ask Steve Jobs. Extraordinary men must give themselves permission to perform extraordinary acts so they can rise above the ordinary.\n\n**Write An Article On AMOGing Beta Males:** The easiest way to AMOG the most Beta Males is to write an article about AMOGing Beta Males. It's pretty simple and has an interesting element of recursion. The key takeaway is understanding why this works. Beta Males are insecure about an endless assortment of trivialities. These insecurities are then weaponized against beta males to make them compensate with overpriced GQ commodities, man up and get married and work a bullshit job until they die. Beta Male insecurities are like MKULTRA control words, they shut down thinking and induce compliance. My advice is to figure out what beta males are insecure about and mention it as casually as possible. Then when the beta male predictably spergs out, use their sperg out as an excuse to exclude them from the decision making process. In other words, exactly how I'm going to use this post to ban a bunch of sensitive losers.\n\n**Do You Even Lift Bro:** The easiest way to increase your SMV, become more confident and have a higher tolerance for stress is to put in serious work at the gym. It's never been easier to find a gym nearby because there's more of them than ever before. Gyms are far better equipped than even 10 years ago. Finally, Bodybuilding is no longer a secretive cult like it was in the 1960s-1990s. All the information you'll ever need is available on YouTube or Amazon bookstore. At this point there is literally no excuse beyond being lazy or retarded. Beta Males know looking like shit is their fault and their fault alone. Broaching the topic directly or just looking fit, is enough to remind them of this fact and send them into an AMOGed spiral. Every article on lifting has hordes of betas crying how jumping jacks in their mom's basement is a legitimate form of exercise. Blue checkmark Twitter is upset that Bronze Age Mindset and fans post physique. Lifting is the universal AMOG. When men feel insecure, their girlfriends notice and look to the source of the insecurity for an opportunity to branch swing. In my experience it's not muscularity itself that gets you laid it's the high stress tolerance gained from becoming muscular and women noticing how other men behave towards you.\n\n**ASStimidation:** while the previous sections explain general AMOGing principals, this section puts it all together in a practical way for a common place situation. Anyone who's spinning plates in 2020 knows that these tardettes are constantly on social media farming their orbiters for validation. What if I told you that there was an easy way to make the orbiters work in for you? Anyone who has been following Red Pill's lifting advice aka applying the Red Pill should have a thick muscular ass from squatting and deadlifting. Steal her phone and then Snapchat or Instagram story a pic of your ass to her orbiters with a flirty caption \"feeling like a snack.\" Wait 20 minutes and send a second pic revealing whose ass it is captioned \"y'all niggas gay\". Within an hour her phone should be blowing up with angry ASStimidated beta males explaining how a mean Alpha hurt their *feeeelings* by AMOGing them. Beta males are two things: thirsty for sexy pics and on the brink of abandoning heterosexuality. If questioned tell her that you were feeling sexy and that you didn't know that all her guy friends are gay.\n\nA lot of men mistakenly believe that being Alpha is using cool tricks to feel confident. Alpha males don't act confident; they are confident because they defeated beta males in competition. Things work in the human world exactly how they work in the animal world. Competition can be physical, musical, financial, intellectual or psychological. Beta males hate competition and hide behind contrived morals to justify their uncompetitiveness. Masculinity is competition. The most masculine animals are the most competitive ones. There is no climbing the dominance hierarchy without competing against other men and AMOGing them in some way. If your goal is to get to the top, you can't just sit around defensively passing shit testsyou have to actively compete against other men.\n\n\nSince everything is currently going into lockdown now is the perfect time to focus on self improvement.

As simple as it is, it will help me stay on track in the times we're living in.\n\n**Take responsibility for your little prison of flesh and everything else will fall into place.** \n\nToday was the first day of this pandemic that I felt like it wasn't going to be easy.\n\nIn the rare occasions I feel down I tend to think \"Welp that's it, I feel like shit and I have no control over the situation so I guess I'll just feel shit until I don't.\"\n\nI know, fkn helpful huh.\n\nThankfully I've been working on this and a lot more. So after a long day of things just not going my way and my overall state of mind not helping I recognised it was time for a good ol' meditation. I have found that taking a breather can go a long way.\n\nSo there I am all zen and shit when I allow my mind to wander a little so I can figure my shit out.\n\nI asked myself what might be one of the oldest questions: Why am I not happy right now?\n\nWell idk I've been taking care of myself. A couple weeks ago I started taking workouts far more seriously (thanks TRP) and doing some yoga too. But hmm now that I think about it such a change in lifestyle can temporarily make you feel drained of energy. I have also been eating well than before BUT HMM now that I think about it I skipped a few meals in the last couple days. And I did (make a conscious decision to) relapse from NoFap today. And yadayadayada\n\nHuh, it makes a whole lotta sense my brain isn't giving me happy chemicals, even tho just a few days ago I was thriving in almost the same routine. I've been on autopilot, haven't I?\n\nSo I considered all my past experiences on this contentment subject and looked for the exact things I haven't been doing.\n\nSurprise surprise, it was nothing I didn't already know subconsciously. And yet I had it so perfectly laid out in front of me that I wrote it down and stuck it in the window in front of my desk. Call it a dogma for contentment:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>**Only by letting go of vices, practicing good habits, and looking after our mind and body,**  \n>  \n>**we can expect to appreciate life and know what we need**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"But a disciplined life without dopamine seems so boring!\"\n\nYou'll be surprised to find how fulfilling it becomes. Not only it's far easier to find contentment, but you also know what you want in order to be happy. \n\nMore specifically, you are more aware of what your body and brain need in order to stay tf out of your way.\n\nLet me break down my experience:\n\n1. **Let go of vices** \\- I was doing NoFap and getting laid consistently so I had to make a smooth transition. Space out masturbation and don't fall into porn. Weed (which is everywhere in my social circles) also tends to make me lazy and can get me down. Social media, youtube videos with no valuable content yadayada. \n2.  **Good habits and looking after yourself** \\- Exercise, yoga, meditation, staying in touch with people, watching a few sunsets and adding variety to the day through a hobby.\n3. **Appreciate Life** \\- The day goes by faster, you enjoy the simple things, you feel fulfilled and in the right course.\n4.  **Know what you need** \\- By going off autopilot and cultivating mindfulness you don't fall back into old habits and you notice what you need as soon as that need arises.\n\nThank you for reading. Honestly, I wrote this more for myself. My state of mind can be quite volatile, which probably isn't the case for most fellas. But I hope it helps someone. Also if there's any grammar mistakes or incongruencies: English ain't my first language.\n\nStay safe, make the most out of the present moment.",

How do you tell yourself that the right guy will come along when you don't really believe it? Why do you not believe that it could happen for you? Regardless of the insanity that we see out there today, love happens. People get married. People move in together. These things happen all the time. You don't have to be young, or beautiful, \\[rich, famous\\], in shape, enough to offer, or have a good credit score. If love happens for this one or for that one then it is possible for me. Whatever we have lived up to in our past, it does not indicate our future. You may want to revisit choices that you dismissed in the past.*\n\nIn the comments below the video, you can find an excerpt from the the despair of women over 25 (and certainly over 30):\n\n*Im 46 years old and it has never happened for me.*\n\n*Its really hard to believe love can happen for me when I have been waiting for so long. Its been 12 years since my divorce, and I am losing hope.*\n\n*It has been 20 years since my divorce.  I've been with several dating agencies, and only had a couple of short - term relationships which have never lasted beyond a few weeks/months.  Just one that lasted about 15 months, but he turned out to be an alcoholic.  I've had a couple of dates just recently, but all he wanted was a friend \"with benefits\" .  I will be 70 this year so just want someone who will prove his worth before anything like that happens.  I'm not as confident about my body, as I was years ago.*\n\n*Im a very affectionate caring loving women aged 35 , men tell me Im attractive all the time.  But I meet a guy we start to date , we get on great he says hes so crazy about me & finds me so attractive & caring and with in a few weeks( longest being 6 mths )the man says he doesnt want commitment & has no feelings for me . This has happen to me about 20 times over the past 15 years. So obviously the issue is me or personality . But I dont know how to fix it.*\n\n*Ive been single coming up 11 years and Im 30yrs old. In your early 20s its ok because you can go out and have fun ect, but late 20s and still dating heaps of men getting nowhere is disheartening. You start to think whats wrong with me, why dont they want a relationship?*\n\nI think that the lesson for women is quite simple.\n\nEither they find a husband while still in their prime age, or else, they will soon end up in a desperate situation.\n\nOf course, that does not change anything on the male side, which first and foremost may want to stay away from the gynocentric court system. So, if a woman is young and pretty, she may still be able convince a younger man, who at that point is still governed by his hormones, to ignore his red-pill lessons and sign up anyway, for a stint on the plantation. Older women are mostly toast, while the video tries to give them hope that they are not (but they do not seem to believe it, really).",

And as we know, women don't have much of a frame at all. That is the source of the confusion. \n\nAs for the much more useful question \"Who am I, the man?\", it never occurs to the average man to ask himself that, let alone answer it. His self awareness is limited to the knowledge that he's got a dick that has begun to work for more than just pissing, that his heart rate is a little higher and maybe his navel's tingling. I doubt if the thought even arose that yes, he is indeed a man... \n\nWhich doesn't help him have a frame of a man in the least, let alone a life worthy of a man. \n\nIt takes men a long way down the road to realize that even if they are doing everything else right, they are still not operating in their frame yet, but trying to find hers. That is more subtle stuff, not as easy to spot as skin and bones or a pot belly, or that you don't even know how to talk to a girl -- but it's the root of the problem. It takes even more experience to learn all the ways in which we're still subconsciously doing it. \n\nIf you have properly gone through the trp factory, when you come out the other end, you should have an honest answer to \"Who am I as a man?\" and \"What kind of woman do I want? \"\n\nAnd even then, growth and learning never end even for the best of us.

Some particular examples I would like to quote,\n\n\"It is easier to find FWB than boyfriends\" (girl 1)\n\n\"Guys believe they are entitled to our bodies; there is almost this one guy in every party who try to rip off my clothes\" (girl 2)\n\n\"I had always felt pressure from woman magazines to look sexy for boys and engage in frequent sex to get the validation I wanted\" (girl 3)\n\n\"I have always felt pressurerized to lose my virginity\" (Guy 1)\n\n\"Sex is not about love anymore, its about pleasure only. I don't have to know a girl to get into her pants. Let me demonstrate you (goes to demonstrate it)... You see, its so easy, the more intoxicated she is, the more likely she will drop her panties\" (Guy 2)\n\n\"I have come with my girlfriend here and I don't mind if she hooks up somewhere \\[lol a cuck\\]\" (Guy 3)\n\nI live in a conservative muslim country where sexual market is controlled and free sex is frowned upon but thanks to feminism it is quickly changing. I used to believe that I had a disadvantage by not being born into a western liberal country but I don't think its true anymore. Its not because the girls are magically better but its because feminism has still not been able to destroy the fabric of this society. A regulated sexual market is both good for men and women, women retain their pair bonding ability and men don't have to worry about being compared to past sexual partners. Its a win-win situation for almost everyone (almost). Most people confuse TRP with another form of seduction and alpha male to be just a fucking machine. However, the reality is that in a society having the concept of masculinity solely revolving around the number of sexual partners could (almost) never produce homely virgin girls (with few exceptoins). The rise of feminsim has seen the rise of pornification of society, single motherhood, divorce rates, false rape accusations and other social ills. Women are slowly turning into walking men with vaginas. They love to masculinize themsleves in order to get the dose of power which they could never taste even if they do they shall never be content because a woman's satisfaction lies in her being protected by a man. Being alpha is not about banging numerous women, this may have been an advantage during the dark ages but we are no longer in the dark ages and sticking to this dogma may damage male pysche as well e.g. depressing over not losing one's virginity due to peer pressure instead of working towards worthwhile goals. Is Dan Brazalian more alpha than an anverage guy who is working towards his goal and fortunately have a stable unicorn?. Hence, we should modify who really is  Alpha male:\n\n1. Always working on self improvment.\n2. Protecting his children and women (unicorn exists in controlled sexual markets).\n3. Resisting Feminism and porn culture.\n4. Achieving goals.\n5. (Add what you think is constructive).\n\nThe degeneration of western society and downfall of fatherhood shall continue to move on if something is not done against this hedonistic feminsim. Although men have taken advantage from this hook up culture but the price which we are paying is far bigger than what can be put into words.  Banging multiple women cannot make our lives better, yes there is a burst of pleasure but its not good long term. I don't think a hook up culture and controlled sexual markets can co-exist ever.\n\nMost men here use TRP knowledge to get into panites which does work because we know the nature of women but to find a traditional homely women is almost impossible.  I utilize TRP knowledge to pass shit test of women and her attraction only grows when you pass her shit tests. I was one of the victims of plantation culture until I came to TRP and received salvation.\n\nlet me know what do you say.",

            "body": "4 simple Activities/Habbits to develop during quarantine in order to transform yourself.Ive seen people talk about how during these times of uncertainty it is important to love and forgive yourself, to allow yourself to eat snacks and trash foods, to spend *(waste)* your time playing video games and binge watching shitty tv shows and Netflix series.\n\nWhile I agree that its good to spend some time having fun and enjoying yourself, this is no excuse to let go and consume your free time. Instead, I **urge** you to **PRODUCE** instead of **CONSUME.**\n\n1.\t**WORK OUT** - Im hopeful that at least 90% of the active users of this sub have already developed and follow a work-out routine. This goes to the people that are not already working out and especially for those who have been working out and have stopped due to the lockdown. Just get yourself up and do it. It doesnt matter what you do, just go for a walk, a job, run, ride your bike, do some push-ups, burpees, bodyweight squats. There is an abundance of exercises you can do anywhere, anytime. Your gym being closed is NOT an excuse to sit on your couch and get fat while you play Call of Duty or something and eating oreos or other trash foods. \nWork out, your body will thank you, your mind will thank you. Working out relieves stress, improves your cardiovascular health, your immune system, as well as your body and mind altogether. If youre struggling to find a routine to follow during quarantine, feel free to shoot me a PM or Ill post a free home workout program here. \n\n2.\t**Start cooking**  Cooking is fucking amazing. It is one of the most relaxing activities I do on a daily basis. Besides the fact that youre being creative and cooking your own meals which helps avoiding trash foods, snacks etc. It is also a perfect time to listen to an audiobook, a podcast or any other educational/self-improvement video/audio. I find myself being extremely focused when I cook and I absorb any information easily. If youre not into audiobooks/podcasts, just put your favorite tunes and vibe it out. But for real, start cooking your own meals, its great and its not as time consuming as you might think it is.\n\n3.\t**Educate yourself**  3 easy suggestions: 1) **Read books.** Any book that seems interesting to you, read it. TRP is the reason I now read books and it has insane benefits for the human brain. It helps me build focus, expand my vocabulary and gain knowledge on a wide spectrum of things (psychology, philosophy, business, finance). It started with The Rational Male and turned into Friedrich fucking Nietzsche and Ancient Greek philosophy. 2) **Take online classes.** There is an abundance of free online classes available. Hell, even watch youtube videos about something and take notes. Its 2020, education is available online and for free. I feel like a moron for wasting 6 years getting 2 university degrees. 3) **Watch documentaries/docuseries instead of TV shows.** Documentaries about anything, serial killers, abuse, gender equality (if you wanna get triggered). Anything is better than watching pointless TV shows. \n\n4.\t**Develop new skill(s)**  On the same note as the above, try to improve yourself by developing a new skill. Two personal examples Im focusing right now are: Learning a new language and experimenting with investing/day trading. But this can be anything, a physical skill (learn how to handstand or smth), play an instrument, learn coding, cooking (see point 2.), fix things, build things, craft etc. Your future self will be glad youve taken the time to develop new skills.\n\n5.\t**Meditate**  Its important to train the mind as well. Take time to dose off, give your head some space. Relax and focus on your breathing and how your body feels. Remember that you are the essence living inside the body, so take care of the presence. Remind yourself of what is within and come to peace with it. It will greatly relieve your stress, anxiety, depression, as well as to improve your sleep and attitude in general.\n\n**Epilogue:**\n\nThis is the perfect time to work on you. Improve you. Fix you. Transcend you. \n\nThere is no excuse for being lazy, having terrible eating habbits and not taking care of yourself. Remember that one day things will go back to normal.

            "body": "The impact of a man's past on him is very different from the impact of a woman's past on her - and the difference can be day and night when the man has the tools to deal with his past.**TL : DR - What doesn't kill a man makes him stronger, once he recovers from it. What doesn't kill a woman damages and enslaves her for life, with recovery a rare exception.**\n\n**We're specifically talking about past experiences here.**\n\nAs tomes of RP posts and reports coming from direct experience would have told you by know, a woman's past does matter a lot. Even a guy like Roosh who had sex with hundreds of women when he retired admitted he'd only want women with zero or low n counts. A man who is sexually very successful is seen as extra attractive despite his reputation while a woman who is too loose is slut shamed or considered washed up especially after she's spent her prime years riding the CC. On Tinder it couldn't be more blatant that 80-90% of the women want to fuck the top 10% of men. A man who fails sexually is an object of ridicule by both women and other men while a woman who saves her body for the best man / men is appreciated for her taste. Instinctively our standards for men and women are opposites. \n\nWhile a feminine dominant society tries to shame men for taking her past into consideration, and shames men for the expectation of wanting either virgins or women with a low n count, while simultaneously encouraging her to be \"sexually liberated\", make \"her choice\" and on top of that later down the road, tries to convince a man that she has \"matured\" or is \"over it\" or \"now knows what she wants\" (lol the irony), we observe the actual scenario and know far better what's really up. Of course, there is always a set of women especially in more conservative countries who are 1-2 generations behind the current state of the West to try to play the \"I want a virgin too or a good man with a low n count card\" in the name of \"equal logic and equal standards\".\n\nWhatever the strategy used by different societies, discussions of one's past bring up fierce debates on unfairness and equality. However life doesn't run on machine logic.\n\nA man's past is a problem for him when it injures him deeply - either physically, or emotionally or mentally, and when he has neither the tools nor the awareness nor the frame to deal with it. If he doesn't find the tools, the results can be catastrophic. One only needs to look at what kind of shit men can land up into - violent crime, abusive relationships, suicides, drugs, alcohol -- and every one of this is due to past trauma that never found space and consciousness to heal.\n\nTo add to the challenge, men often do not have support systems, those whom he needs in his low moments ditch him for the good times and he is ridiculed for trying to seek help. Man is ridiculed for even saying he has a problem. Even in effective support systems meant to help him, he has to face at least 50 people all calling him a faggot for every mistake and has to earn his respect (MRP, I'm looking at you...and respect you). A man learns soon that there is no substitute for strength and being proactive.\n\nLet's make the exception for lasting physical trauma. Soldiers who come back with PTSD and worse from wars have often been found to have suffered lasting brain injuries and lesions, which are responsible for the symptoms. Some people with an altered personality have been known to have had a brain tumor in a particular part of their brain. So, physical damage is the one thing a man might totally not recover from. But that hasn't stopped them from trying.\n\nBut when a man does have the tools and cultivates some awareness and frame, the mental and emotional scars can soon be overcome, and except severe injuries that caused permanent damage to the body, many injuries and diseases can also be fixed medically today. Everyone who has ever contributed to RP awareness has shared their own tools from their toolbox for this purpose (for those who ask). I too found some really powerful tools for me, which I have shared.\n\nOnce a man has somehow found the space he needs to make even a little peace with his past, his problem solving mind gets to work, learning lessons from the experience, developing a new mindset and approach, looking at what went wrong and how to improve his results. Recognizing that there is no support granted to him, but the need must still be addressed nevertheless, a man decides to create what is missing in life himself, walking the hard path. It is a long an arduous road to create what has not existed before.\n\nIf needed, man seeks out discomfort in planned doses, gains additional experiences, works on himself and gets better and better every time with each additional experience, every failure and success until he masters the challenges that once seemed impossible to him. As every rep he does stimulates more muscle to grow afterward, men simply improve with experience. Men use their past to attain mastery in the present. Man essentially runs on the paradigm **\"What doesn't kill you makes you stronger\"**. Of course let's be practical and add this line - **\"Once he recovers from it. \"**\n\nThis is also and especially true for sex. A man who has embraced his sexuality gets better at the game with every experience.\n\nA man once awakened, doesn't mind systematically annihilating his past dysfunctional self to become a more evolved being.\n\nA bad past however has a much worse impact on a woman, given her much greater sensitivity. It creates a self perpetuating trauma pattern in her that keeps her locked in it. If her past was abusive, expect her to have a much greater tendency to pair up with the abusive assholes and suffer all her life, even if it means her children suffer at times. 10 minutes of sex god and she is alpha widowed for life and can't enjoy sex that way with other men again. 10 years of riding the cock carousel before settling down with a nice provider means it's only a matter of time before she gets bored with marriage and aspires for the thrill of the chase again  -- once unstable relationships, always unstable relationships. Or if she gets violated against her will, she can feel horrible, ashamed, dirty, even defiled and this can make it impossible for her to let go and enjoy herself with a future lover. There is no end to those complications and all the forms past unresolved emotions can take. \n\n**In matters involving any significant intensity of emotion, a woman essentially becomes the victim of her past pleasure and pain.**\n\nBitter experiences can force women to wear the pants, man up and step up to the challenges, especially if her mama mode is activated. But these usually leave her still scarred bitterly at the emotional level. A woman who has to wear the pants in the house invariably develops contempt for the man who doesn't. Behind every feminist champion, you can always find a woman emotionally scarred to some degree or the other.  Tough women especially carry boat loads of unresolved emotional pain. There are many such women who have manned up only to lose faith in men and carry bitterness and contempt towards men for not having the manliness that a woman was capable of summoning. \n\nUnresolved past sexual trauma can subconsciously force a woman to make herself unattractive and unhealthy, which is what we see in many feminists, as a way to avoid the possibility of a repeat of that experience and getting hurt again. By comparison, men who are hurt try to avoid relationships. \n\nThe tendency of the feminine ego to seek refuge in the feeling of victim hood does not help in this - it helps keep her past alive in her. A bad past just gives the victim tendency a first class ticket.\n\nThe fact that women tend to be a herd animal with a significant collective hive mind component to their existence makes it worse. In one room, all that one woman has to do is to bring out her past emotions and you can be sure that within minutes, even seconds, that all the women are feeling the same thing. The impact of past experiences on a woman is simply deeper and bigger already due to their sensitive nature, and it only gets multiplied further by the collective pain body of the feminine.\n\nWe even see this any time she's in a bad mood -- they remember past miseries and mistakes in excruciating detail don't they? Not all of a woman's pain or emotion is hers alone, it's the pain and emotion of womankind.\n\nLet's not even get started on bad habits. Women who get into drinking and drug abuse wreck their lives and the lives of their families and children in spectacularly horrible ways. And once it starts it becomes near impossible for them to stop. I see a lot of men in mrp in the OYS threads working on their addictions from alcohol to the smartphone and porn, but I don't get to see many woman come out of deep shit by themselves. They'll need help, if they are capable of being helped at that point that is.\n\nWhile a man can get to enjoy the feeling of mastery at the end of his struggles and suffering and victory, a woman is still left with a bitter taste in her psyche and lots of unresolved pain even if she ends up succeeding. Even success doesn't seem to fill up a woman's emotional holes - you can see this with any successful woman who had to wear the pants to get there. There is some unhappiness in their tone, as though they regret the impact it had on their femininity. \n\nAs for a history of crazy sexual behaviour, when I see the stories of many of these women, with notch counts that would have been impossible without contraception, their troubling past prior to that, along all the thoughts and emotions that these women admit to having over time swinging across the entire spectrum, and add the impact of powerful sexual memory on their system, all I can say is that it's a case of absolutely fucked up, both inside and out. The fuck up outside just reflects the fuck up on the inside, and makes it worse. The biggest mistake is to assume and believe what they say as if the impact of such powerful emotions and experiences can simply be wished away by rationalization. \n\nA lifetime spent running full throttle in one direction will never magically fix itself overnight. \n\nAs I wrote in my post on the irony of \"Choice\", it is stupid to think you are choosing when your mind has this much grip over you. These women may claim they are over it, but deep down their minds are still in the same deep turmoil of thoughts and emotions as ever and they have never addressed that. That software runs freely on the inside, just hidden. That won't stay quiet for long. Sooner or later their unhappy selves are going to emerge for the next round of seeking salvation elsewhere, or they are going to go crazy. \n\nAnd that's why you should never listen to their claims that they've overcome their past. That as you will read below, requires exceptional work, the honesty to face oneself and take responsibility for once, and they should have clearly done it and have results to show for it. You cannot practice instability all your life and then hope to stay stable and committed one fine day. How in the world did men start believing that shit and even white knighting for it by any logic is beyond me.\n\nSo for all but the most spiritual of women, a woman essentially runs on the paradigm of being a victim of her past -- **\"What doesn't kill her enslaves her\". Recovery? Oh God...**\n\nWhy I said all but the most spiritual women was that there are some women who do find tools to work on themselves, a few do end up recovering from their past experiences, but if you've ever read some of the books written by them on the subject, you can tell that the recovery process is a battle, involving massive emotional releases, moments of very altered moods and the like - it's like 4th of July. The key difficulty is that women being more emotional, find the way of awareness and inner peace inherently more difficult, and have a lot of extra pain to resolve. Usually devotion, service, nurturing others and emotional methods work much easier with them (which is why more women than men go seek religion). But it is not impossible, and the tools can also work extremely well with them.\n\nIn fact most of the tools will work on anyone who is serious about using them.\n\nTrouble is, many of these women are too deep into the grip of their own past patterns to get to the start line even. It takes women years of work to get to a point where a lot of their traumatic patterns are dissolved and we're back on a clean slate, though by then, they might not even be physically in their prime. Biologically women have a shorter prime than men to bear healthy children and then be healthy enough to raise them to adulthood. Men on the other hand, can keep their physical and reproductive prime up for longer.\n\nThe task of \"annihilating their past unhappy self\" is therefore much harder for a woman and needs more work. A man would find it easier to help himself or recruit help where he doesn't find help by default, but women really do need far more hand holding when dealing with deep inner pain. Sometimes absolute dominance is probably the only way to force them to start to work on themselves.\n\nBiologically a woman who has a bad past or a history of bad habits, or even a very stressed history has a much greater chance of hurting the physical and mental health of an unborn child. In old school societies, lots of care is taken to see to it that pregnant women are kept emotionally \"well fed\". Just a history of lots of stresses, irregular hours of food, diet and rest can damage their fertility and reproductive health. No one mentions the impact of abortions and contraception on reproductive health and hormonal balance. A woman's body is a significant biological investment, and men are biologically wired to be repelled by women with a history of destructive habits and behavior.\n\nDo keep in mind though that a man's bad habits like smoking and drinking and sedentary living also damage his reproductive health and T levels, but again, good habits, lifting and diet can go a long long way to correcting this. Fitness also has equally positive effects on a woman's health, but most unhealthy women I tell you also come with a significant degree of mental and emotional illness and are too far in a hell hole to even turn up at the gym. **Most women who are unhealthy today are actually so because of an underlying emotional or mental problem, while most men are just plain lazy**. In my world, women will have to lift, do yogic practices and meditate. For their own good. I won't accept those not willing.\n\nAmidst all this, anything a woman gains in technical skill from her sexual experiences can easily become irrelevant. Besides, a skilled man can always train a willing woman (go to mrp and see that latest post), leaving her free to concentrate on the seduction part of her game.\n\nI honestly feel sadness and pity for many of these women whom I see, broken wrecks of what could have been. I couldn't stay cold about it if it happened to any of the women in my family or life, but honestly, they're doing it to themselves and save-a-hoe is just stupid -- the foolish nice guy who wants to save them and change them just gets swept into that shit and realizes too late that this is way beyond his power to solve, and he might not even be able to get out safely from crazy. \n\nIn the case of woman and the impact of her past on her psyche, prevention was always far better than cure. Let's be real about that. That's why old societies were always so strict with their women. \n\nSo in the end, a man's past can end up making him stronger and wiser and he can look back at it honestly without toxic shame, with a degree of pride and gratitude even -- as a very harsh teacher, but the one he needed, that taught him permanent lessons. Women on the other hand, are often left with permanent or lasting physical and psychological damage from their pasts far more than lessons learned. Men become responsible for themselves over their past, women become victims of their past.\n\n**And that's why a man's past and a woman's past are simply not comparable.** We're not denying that men too get damaged from their past, but unless its a serious physical injury, it is indeed easier to recover from that and emerge stronger than it is for a woman. What doesn't kill a man makes him stronger once he recovers from it. What doesn't kill a woman tortures her for the rest of her life. And that is how it goes for all but the most exceptional cases.\n\n*PS : When I used the word \"past\", it wasn't in the context of reputation, but past experiences. Now about reputation -- A woman's reputation did matter enormously in societies of the past, and I myself know that my grandmother would have preferred death to shame and loss of reputation. But in a feminine primary society, the sisterhood will defend her in public, encourage her in private and bitch about her behind her back. Yes, that last part is true.*\n\n*A man's reputation however is everything, especially in this kind of society. It is more vulnerable than the most delicate and sensitive woman, and as easy to shatter as glass, and easier to damage forever. A woman will cast allegations on you, even and especially false ones if it benefits her, her sisters will vilify you as a monster, your rival men, her orbiters, and envious betas will rush to her aid, glad to see your downfall, the white knights and SJWs will attack you, and the justice system exists for the sole purpose of screwing you forever, you'll be abused and raped in prison hell, you're out of the job market, the feminist dominated media will write any shit on you if it sells, society treats you in ways they didn't treat slaves or untouchables, and your best hope is to actually STFU and fight to the end --* ***rape of a man is the rape of his reputation and freedom.*** *Once raped, it will never recover to the way it was formerly.* *Only God alone can save you if truth is on your side TBH. So remember Law #5 always --* ***So much depends on reputation, guard it with your life!***",

Some of them are still struggling on the same level they were a couple of years ago. \n\nI have a close friend that paid the same amount of money for a meditation course.

This is done by giving away free value and content in order to establish their brand. \n\nAnother side effect of giving away free content is that it leaves the potential client with thoughts such as - Well if all this great content is free, imagine what the paid product will do for my life\n\nThe truth is that the product being sold to you will likely contain the same information that you can buy as a book on Amazon for a few dollars instead of hundreds and thousands through an online course. \n\nThe YouTube videos will contain a link to a landing page for the product steeped in marketing techniques such as scarcity marketing, big colorful buttons, and graphics. It will contain powerful statements such as:\n\n* Live An Incredible Life...NOW\n* Feel Unstoppable In Your Personal and Business Life\n* Unleash your Authentic Self\n\nYou get the message - whats funny is once you have seen one landing page you have seen them all. Another strategy you will come across is the discrediting of the original source and author. \n\nSure all these books and authors are great, but they dont teach you how to take practical steps - which I do\n\nEven well-established success gurus such as Tony Robbins have had personal models.

I'm not saying that paying 1000 dolars to some stupid youtube influencer is the way to go, but for some people it will help (assuming that the dude is not bs and is actually selling something good), after all, 1000 dolars for changing your life is still very cheap.

            "body": "She'll never tell you what she really means.I come back to this sub after a 2 year hiatus of regular dwelling. I checked in from time to time, but I never stopped reading books, learning and improving myself.  \n  \nFirst off, it goes without saying, thanks for all the teachings and advice. I'm happily able to say I see myself in a million times better position in most if not all aspects of my life. Before I found this sub I was playing video games until 5am and jacking it to porn multiple times daily because I was a raged filled beta hoping the next woman would be 'different'. However, my priorities have changed and I'm now on the right path for my own success and fulfilment. The women are a bonus.  \n  \nAnyways, I'll get into the story of a little experience I had a couple months ago, reinforcing AWALT.  \n  \n---  \n  \nSo, one of my plates finally did a little wobble, then came crashing down. She was a solid fuck with a banging body and ate dick like it's candy.  \n  \nAs a background, we'd never done more than fuck and neither of us had spent the night. She barely knew a thing about me and all of our time was spent at one anothers place. No outside dates, no romance, a straight up plate. We met in a bar and she was a ONS turned plate after she hit me up a few days later.  \n  \nWe'd just finished up a good fuck session one evening and she starts getting dressed ready to leave, when out of the blue she starts spewing this without prior context:  \n*\"How do you manage to go through life so detached, sitting there like you're royalty while I wait around for you to MAN UP?\"*  \n*\"What do you mean? Did I go a little soft inside of you?\"*  \n*'NO, we've been doing this for too long and you haven't even had the balls yet to take things to the next level\"*  \n*\"Ohh that's what this is. No can do, my balls shrivelled up years ago'*  \n*\"YOU'RE A DISGUSTING PRICK, YOU'VE NEVER GIVE ME THE RESPECT I DESERVE FROM YOU. FUCK YOU\"*  \n  \nI honestly thought she was joking at first, as it just didn't make sense given the terms we were on. Then she made her dramatic exit, door slam for effect. I sat there baffled by what'd just come from her, but stuck on a docuseries and thought she'd come around.  \n  \nA week or so passes and I hadn't heard from her. Then I get a phone call late on a Thursday night from her. I pick up and she's slurring her words, sounds like she's drunk and been crying.  \n  \nGives me the good old speech:  \n*\"I love you so much and it kills me inside that you're being like this, I don't understand how you can lead me on like this. I don't want to be with anyone else but you, we have so much fun together but you just don't feel the same way\"*  \nI give her a serious-ish answer this time, she seems pretty beat up:  \n*\"I thought we were clear when this started on what this was all about? I've never made any hints to anything more than fucking or expressed any emotion. You're being irrational, take a step back and calm down\"*  \n*\"blah blah you don't understand, you're different to other guys etc etc.\"*  \n  \nShe eventually hangs up after I let her waffle on and I don't hear from her at all for a while.  \n  \nThe following Tuesday I was hanging out with one of my buddies and tells me he saw plate in question at a party on the Saturday, following the Thursday she called me. Said she fucked a guy right there at the party and made it well known to people that *I knew* there.  \n  \nSo wait... That doesn't add up right? Literally 2 days before she was telling me all that, but she goes to a party and suddenly it's all nullified? /s (To be clear, this didn't come as a shock to me)  \n  \nLater the next week she texted me asking if I was free to 'talk', I haven't responded, neither of us are losing anything in this situation. I'm simply protecting myself from potential unnecessary further drama.  \n  \n---  \n  \n**What do I take from this?**  \n  \n* She'll tell you anything she thinks you want to hear, hold frame and let it play out.

            "body": "I Have Been Doing Cold Approach For 2 Years Now: This Is How I Went From Kissless Handholdless Virgin To 15 Lays In 1 Month&#x200B;\n\nAbout 3 years ago, I was a 29 year old Asian guy with only a couple months to go before I turned 30, working at a Big 3 Accounting Firm, and I was realizing that I was unhappy and miserable, working long hours at all times of the day and night and spending all my free time playing Overwatch, and Dota 2\n\nAnd despite earning good money, I had a house and some savings, I just knew my life was NOWHERE near where I wanted it to be or thought it SHOULD be, despite all the years of hard work because I was FOREVER ALONE. I was still a virgin at age 29. A kissless handholdless virgin I just wanted to take the time to finally get this off my chest since I have nothing better to do during the quarantine.\n\nI soon decided, with the help of an epiphany while reading an article on RedPill titled HOW TO GET LAID LIKE A WARLORD that this was not the life for me and that I would need to start approaching girls and learning game to have any hope of losing my virginity before 30\n\nI didn't want to become a 100+ lay gigachad like the article outlined:\n\n* I just wanted to experience what other guys experienced in college that I missed out on.\n* I just wanted to have someone I could share my hopes and struggles with, someone I could come home to and hug if I had a bad day.\n* I just wanted to have some fun before I get married and start a family\n\nWas that really too much to ask?\n\nSo I quickly began to learn about game and seduction and browsed Reddit and other forums almost daily to get hyped up and learn how to do cold approach. I soon discovered, however, that I had bitten off far more than I could chew\n\nI met up with a white guy I met online who seemed equally as motivated as me to go out and approach and we went out to several bars and clubs together. Every time we went out, he would always go home with a new girl, mostly Asian girls Im not proud of it, but I was extremely jealous since none of these girls gave me any kind of IOIs or other signs of attraction when I approached, and stopped going out with him. Now, I realize it's because he went to the gym a lot and always had a nice haircut, but back then, It was kind of ridiculous how Id approach girl after girl and get one word answers and a GO AWAY vibe the entire conversation and he would come in a few minutes later and THE SAME GIRL would be smiling and asking him questions about himself, it felt like he didnt even need to do any work to get laid\n\nAt this point, I was watching pickup videos from or reading articles on how to get girls on an almost daily basis, trying to study and learn all the latest game techniques. It felt like I hit a brick wall. This was SOOO much harder than I thought it would be. The HOW TO GET LAID LIKE A WARLORD article specifically said that women would rather fuck an ugly guy with a strong frame than a handsome guy with a weak one but that didnt seem to be the case. I was a 55 Asian guy competing with 60+ white guys at every club I went to and it felt like no matter what I said, no girls were even willing to have an actual conversation with me. This is after 100+ approaches so I knew that it wasnt just bad luck or lack of effort.\n\nSo reluctantly, after learning some valuable lessons about the harsh nature of reality, I invested $2997 in a well known pickup bootcamp since I figured I was already watching so many of their videos, and its only fair that I pay them and hopefully learn how to break through my sticking points since my strategy of trying to learn everything by myself was clearly failing.\n\nFor those of you thinking about going to a PUA Bootcamp, be very careful you don't waste all your money like I did. This particular company did not give a single FUCK about me other than my money. My instructor just kept telling me to approach and approach, which I already knew how to do, and every time I asked for feedback on why none of the girls seemed receptive, he would give some bullshit feedback on how my vibe was off. I asked him how to correct it and he never had any real answers, always giving some woo woo answer about how I needed to have outcome independence and have more fun. It was really weird that everyone who seemed to succeed seemed to be the type to go to the gym a lot and pay a lot of attention to their physical appearance, even though they teach that looks don't matter.\n\nI finally lost my virginity through sheer luck after over 500 approaches. It was a fat and ugly latina girl who was so drunk she didnt know where she was and I just happened to be there to help her home but it still counts. At this point, I was so desperate that I tried to go out on dates with her and become her boyfriend but she stopped responding to my texts after the second date Over the next couple of years, I became obsessed with getting good with girls, which certainly kept me going, but it also caused some problems\n\nI went out with so many wingmen, hoping to find that gold nugget, that shining piece of knowledge or wisdom that would finally catapult me past this unbreakable wall, but they would either be just as bad with girls as me or be over 5'10\", no exceptions. I read an article on Reddit about how you had to talk louder and slower and that actually helped a lot. Girls would actually give me a chance to have a conversation with them instead of rejecting me immediately but they would still shake their head when I asked them to go home with me or even just grab a drink together. That's when it hit me that I didn't know as much as I thought I did and that there was a lot more to learn.\n\nThe bad news is, all this rejection was not good for my mental health. I started to wonder if maybe a short Asian guy like myself is just not meant to procreate I was seriously considering moving to Thailand or The Philippines to try to at least find a gold digger wife\n\nBut finally, I found one particular dating coach that really resonated with me and I immersed myself in his training He was 57 and Asian, so a short Asian like me.\n\nThe first thing he told me was that my hairstyle, fashion, and body language were all shit and unless I fix them first, nothing else would work. Now this is completely contradictory to some of the other advice I read like the HOW TO GET LAID LIKE A WARLORD article which convinced me that looks dont matter but I decided to give it a shot. I got a blazer and chinos from Zara and got an undercut haircut with faded sides along with a gold watch. I didnt expect anything to happen right away but the difference in girls reactions really was noticeable IMMEDIATELY. Suddenly, they would hang in and listen to every word I had to say instead of just politely waiting for me to leave. One girl even started asking me questions about myself and followed me when I asked her to grab a drink with me! I was SOOO HAPPY, it felt like everything changed.\n\nNext, he told me to fix my posture and stand up perfectly straight with no neck or back tilt. This was really hard for me because I spent my entire adult life playing video games and working in front of a computer, always hunched over. I even had to go to a chiropractor to undo the years of bad habits and damage to my posture but it finally got fixed after I started wearing a back brace like they give to scoliosis patients. Again, I noticed immediate results. I actually pulled a girl home this time and got a blowjob! No lay thought because of last minute resistance\n\nThe one thing that really transformed my results though was to speak to girls with vocal variety. I had a very monotone voice that didnt change in volume or pitch at all. He had me watch episodes of F.R.I.E.N.D.S and we noticed that every character spoke with such vocal variety and inflections that it sounded like they were speaking in color compared to my black and white. This did not come easy but I worked had on it until it was at least somewhat passable. This turned out to be the tipping point and I finally started getting laid regularly when I go out instead of once every 500 approaches like before. Overall, I'm very happy to have fucked 15 girls. I know that's not a lot compared to some other guys on here but it's a big improvement over ZERO.\n\nThats kind of the level Im at right now. The girls arent like model level 9s or 10s yet but Ive gotten a 7 before, mostly 5s and 6s but its a massive improvement over nothing. The quarantine obviously put approaching on hold but luckily, I already had a plate I was regularly seeing before shit hit the fan, so Im not wanting for sex, just spending my days reading and learning as much as I can about working out and nutrition since I got fatter from the quarantine and plan on hitting the gym as soon as things open back up. Hope everyone reading this is safe and got some value from my post. Just needed to get this off my chest before work starts up again.",

This is after 100+ approaches so I knew that it wasnt just bad luck or lack of effort.\n\nSo reluctantly, after learning some valuable lessons about the harsh nature of reality, I invested $2997 in a well known pickup bootcamp since I figured I was already watching so many of their videos, and its only fair that I pay them and hopefully learn how to break through my sticking points since my strategy of trying to learn everything by myself was clearly failing.\n\nFor those of you thinking about going to a PUA Bootcamp, be very careful you don't waste all your money like I did. This particular company did not give a single FUCK about me other than my money. My instructor just kept telling me to approach and approach, which I already knew how to do, and every time I asked for feedback on why none of the girls seemed receptive, he would give some bullshit feedback on how my vibe was off. I asked him how to correct it and he never had any real answers, always giving some woo woo answer about how I needed to have outcome independence and have more fun. It was really weird that everyone who seemed to succeed seemed to be the type to go to the gym a lot and pay a lot of attention to their physical appearance, even though they teach that looks don't matter.\n\nI finally lost my virginity through sheer luck after over 500 approaches. It was a fat and ugly latina girl who was so drunk she didnt know where she was and I just happened to be there to help her home but it still counts. At this point, I was so desperate that I tried to go out on dates with her and become her boyfriend but she stopped responding to my texts after the second date Over the next couple of years, I became obsessed with getting good with girls, which certainly kept me going, but it also caused some problems\n\nI went out with so many wingmen, hoping to find that gold nugget, that shining piece of knowledge or wisdom that would finally catapult me past this unbreakable wall, but they would either be just as bad with girls as me or be over 5'10\", no exceptions. I read an article on Reddit about how you had to talk louder and slower and that actually helped a lot. Girls would actually give me a chance to have a conversation with them instead of rejecting me immediately but they would still shake their head when I asked them to go home with me or even just grab a drink together. That's when it hit me that I didn't know as much as I thought I did and that there was a lot more to learn.\n\nThe bad news is, all this rejection was not good for my mental health. I started to wonder if maybe a short Asian guy like myself is just not meant to procreate I was seriously considering moving to Thailand or The Philippines to try to at least find a gold digger wife\n\nBut finally, I found one particular dating coach that really resonated with me and I immersed myself in his training He was 57 and Asian, so a short Asian like me.\n\nThe first thing he told me was that my hairstyle, fashion, and body language were all shit and unless I fix them first, nothing else would work. Now this is completely contradictory to some of the other advice I read like the HOW TO GET LAID LIKE A WARLORD article which convinced me that looks dont matter but I decided to give it a shot. I got a blazer and chinos from Zara and got an undercut haircut with faded sides along with a gold watch. I didnt expect anything to happen right away but the difference in girls reactions really was noticeable IMMEDIATELY. Suddenly, they would hang in and listen to every word I had to say instead of just politely waiting for me to leave. One girl even started asking me questions about myself and followed me when I asked her to grab a drink with me! I was SOOO HAPPY, it felt like everything changed.\n\nNext, he told me to fix my posture and stand up perfectly straight with no neck or back tilt. This was really hard for me because I spent my entire adult life playing video games and working in front of a computer, always hunched over. I even had to go to a chiropractor to undo the years of bad habits and damage to my posture but it finally got fixed after I started wearing a back brace like they give to scoliosis patients. Again, I noticed immediate results. I actually pulled a girl home this time and got a blowjob! No lay thought because of last minute resistance\n\nThe one thing that really transformed my results though was to speak to girls with vocal variety. I had a very monotone voice that didnt change in volume or pitch at all. He had me watch episodes of F.R.I.E.N.D.S and we noticed that every character spoke with such vocal variety and inflections that it sounded like they were speaking in color compared to my black and white. This did not come easy but I worked had on it until it was at least somewhat passable. This turned out to be the tipping point and I finally started getting laid regularly when I go out instead of once every 500 approaches like before. Overall, I'm very happy to have fucked 15 girls. I know that's not a lot compared to some other guys on here but it's a big improvement over ZERO.\n\nThats kind of the level Im at right now. The girls arent like model level 9s or 10s yet but Ive gotten a 7 before, mostly 5s and 6s but its a massive improvement over nothing. The quarantine obviously put approaching on hold but luckily, I already had a plate I was regularly seeing before shit hit the fan, so Im not wanting for sex, just spending my days reading and learning as much as I can about working out and nutrition since I got fatter from the quarantine and plan on hitting the gym as soon as things open back up. Hope everyone reading this is safe and got some value from my post. Just needed to get this off my chest before work starts up again.",

One of her replies contained an old parable I'd learned years ago but had forgotten till I read that thread. For those that struggle with self confidence; insecurities and negative self talk; this was her reply;\n\n*Thats a hard one, as I incorporate a lot of the tips I share with my students from meditation to exercise to trying to protect my time affluence.*\n\n*But if I had to pick one, Id say the most important insight comes from the fact that that we can control our reactions to the bad situations in life. Its an insight that comes from the ancient stoics but also from the Buddhist parable of the second arrow. Which goes something like this Buddha asks his followers if its bad to get hit with an arrow when youre walking down the street, which they quicky agree it is. Then he asks if its worse to get hit with a second arrow. All the followers agree that yup, getting hit with two arrows would suck more. Buddha goes on to explain that the first arrow is our of our control thats all the bad stuff that happens to us in life. But the second arrow is our reaction to those bad events whether we get angry or upset and make things worse. That second arrow is always up to us.*\n\n*And so Id say the biggest insight thats had a positive effect on my own life is NOT to hit myself with that second arrow.* - Dr Laurie Santos \n\nDuring my teens I grew up with fairly high expectations. At the time I was expected to work, excel at studies and then contribute wherever else I was required. It's a gruelling weight to bear when there's so much expectation. I was drinking with my uncles and cousins one time and after relaying my woes; one uncle told me not keep shooting myself with *the second arrow*. He then told that same story. At the time I had a deep seeded doubt that the path I was forced upon; I wasn't up to. Insecurities, self doubt and my negative internal dialogue were eroding my confidence. Gaining that perspective however, then applying it; changed my world view. It irrevocably changed my frame. \n\nWe all face adversity. Frame; and the base of its strength comes from a choice. We don't have a choice getting shot with the first arrow; **but we CAN consciously chose not to shoot ourselves with the second arrow.** \n\n*Godspeed and good luck!*",

So what did he do? He dropped her instantly. Good move on his part. \n\nWhile I don't advocate snooping around emails and social media to dig up possible dirt I will say he did the right thing by confronting her and kicking her to the curb. \n\nHowever in his post someone dropped a comment titled \"Be like Pete\" and I clicked it. It took me to an archived post from 2016 on the Relationships sub in which a woman had posted that she got dumped for suggesting to her then BF that she was going to visit in an Ex in another country. \n\n[Read the post for yourself](https://archive.is/uULD2).. \n\n**Lessons learned:**  \n\n\\-Have abundance Mentality: Pete gave no fucks. He knew he could find another chick and didn't care about spending the last 6 months with her. It's easy to drop a girl for bad behavior if you have an abundance mindset aka the confidence in knowing you can easily find more woman. A beta in scarcity mindset would convince himself to keep a bad woman around for fear of being alone.\n\n\\-Never keep a woman in your life who would even suggest visiting an Ex. It's a huge red flag but she also tried to spin it on him saying he was abusive for not thinking she should do it.  \n\n\\-Men don't want to be friends with good looking women. She honestly thought her ex was just platonic and yet the moment she told him she got dumped he said \"great now we can bang.\" (Paraphrasing that) \n\nI did a video on this [here](https://youtu.be/Q1osgqLiN6E) if you prefer audio narration of these lessons.",

She books the ticket before mentioning anything to her BF because:\nthey were on sale for a ridiculously low price on the dates that he would be there, so I jumped at the opportunity.\n\n>Boyfriend breaks up with her without loosing frame and even 'that' subreddit calls her out for being wrong.\n\n>Body: So they've dated for 6 months and she thinks that going alone to Amsterdam to meet up with an \"ex from ancient history who is more like a best-friend\" is a good idea. She starts with the excuses even in the title.\n\n>Her boyfriend shows exactly how a situation like this are to be handled, no harsh words, no complaining about not going simply holding frame:\n\n>Pete seemed cool with it at first but after a few days asked me if there was any history between us. I was honest and told him there was. He didn't seem too bothered and eventually asked if I thought visiting an ex in another country was appropriate whilst in a relationship. I explained to him how Dave and my relationship wasn't like that and that we were strictly platonic. He didn't seem to really react, he just gave me a look that was...sarcastic, I suppose, would be the best way to describe it.\n\n>Edit: \"he just gave me a look that was...sarcastic\" -> \"dont need to talk, just grin\" (c) Endorsed TRP-philosophy.\n\n>First he calmly suspects that this is more than platonic and asks her and her hamster believes that going a week to Amsterdam with an ex to do drugs and partying is a sign of a \"platonic friendship\" and feels safe confessing that he is actually an ex. He then proceeds to ask if she think its appropriate (not telling her its not, just vetting to see if she is really LTR material).\nShe then pulls out the \"strong independent black woman\" card as a response:\n\n>I then told him that I wouldn't be controlled and hated men that thought they owned me and could tell me what to do. I told him I was free to see who I wanted and that I found his lack of trust in me upsetting, disrespectful and, perhaps, a sign of future abusiveness. I now realise that this may have been a bad thing to say. Again, he didn't really react so I thought that was the end of it.\n\n>Here most men would have caved, given her reasons not go, told her not to go or even worse, supported the idea of the trip because nobody wants to be an \"abusive boyfriend\". Her boyfriend on the other hand shows exactly how to hold frame he even explains it to her:\n\n>Then, last night, he came around to my flat and broke up with me! I asked him why and tried to get him to explain himself and he told me that my going away was to see \"another man\" a deal-breaker, that he'd been in this type of situation before and wasn't going to go through it again. I asked him if this was an ultimatum - I hate ultimatums, they are tools of abusers - and he said \"No, its not an ultimatum. I've decided to break up with you. I have not presented you with any options. I just came to say goodbye.\" Before I could say or do anything more, he kissed me on the forehead, said goodbye and walked away. He didn't seem angry, just...sad.\n\n>No harsh words, no ultimatums, no anger, just HELD FRAME. He realise a women that cant show her relationship the respect it deserves dont deserve him and he simply lets her go.\nHere comes some bonus:\n\n>To make matters worse, I told Dave about what happened and he replied \"Oh well, guess that means we can have even more fun then! ;o)\" He didn't care about my relationship and my pain - he just wanted a hookup buddy and someone to get stoned with whilst he was in Amsterdam.\nSuprise, her ex-boyfriend didnt invite her to Amsterdam to party to have a platonic friendship re-kindle. \n\n>Obviously both men in this story knew exactly what was up but she comes to the Internet asking for advice of what went wrong.\n\n>I tried calling Pete today, about an hour ago, and he actually answered! He told me that I should look to be with someone who wasn't so abusive. He said, \"Please stop calling me - this is over. Have a nice trip to Amsterdam\" Then he BLOCKED me! How could he do that to someone he loves? Is he over reacting or was I? What should I do now? Was I wrong?\n\n>\"How could he do that to someone he loves?\" she asks herself without any self-reflection (until even the Internet told her that yes, you were wrong).\n\n>Lessons learnt:\n>Women believe in their hamsters, they are not lying when they say they \"didnt cheat\" or \"it just happened\", just because she believes her own lies dont mean you have to.\nHold frame, even if your girlfriend is planning on going on a fuck-trip to Amsterdam with an EX.\nAWALT?",

So insidious is the enemy that many cannot even see it or know it.  \n\nIt is the difference between a rich man and a poor man. A CEO and an underling. A 'has' and a 'has not'. Someone who learns from those who have paved a successful path and someone who complains that they can't be successful and gives excuses.  \n\nThat enemy of man is Instant Gratification.  \n\n**Examples include:** \n\n\\-Eating a sugary treat when you know you should eat healthy \n\n\\-Hitting the snooze button instead of jumping out of bed and working out \n\n\\-Going out with friends instead of studying finishing that project or studying for that exam \n\n\\-Taking out a high interest loan and eventually shelling out way more money for it instead of saving for it and paying with cash \n\n\\-Playing video games instead of building out a business or brand or any other passion that could actually make you money \n\n\\-Looking at porn and shooting your mojo into a tissue instead of letting it build up and guiding you into starting new relationships\n\nIn the end, all of these things come down to you being addicted to dopamine. Your body will supply you with dopamine when you do any of the above and there are many more examples than what I just listed.  \n\nSo what is the answer to fighting this? Well that should be obvious.  \n\nThe ally in this fight is Delayed Gratification. But how do we get in contact with this ally?  \n\nYou can throw away your video games and your drugs if you need to. It's an extreme method of control, but if you are constantly succumbing to instant gratification it is something to consider.  \n\nOne of my favorite ways to do that is this:  \n\nGet in touch with your 'future-self' and ask yourself now what you wish you had done as your 'past-self.'  \n\nFor example... where do you want to be in 20 years? Perhaps a nice house on some big land. 3 cars. Maybe some kids. Maybe not. But do you really want to be living in your parents basement or with roommates? What is your 50 year old self going to say to your 25 year old self? Let me tell you this... as a 34 year old man I curse my 21 year old self. I had ample opportunity to be in the military.. to study hard.. to lift weights earlier.. to be much more successful earlier on. But no, I pissed my early and mid 20s away with video games, marijuana and porn. Yes I still bedded women but for what? My success today is largely based on choices I made in my 30s. My 50 year old self has desires and I cannot let that future man down.  \n\nDo not let your future-self down! \n\n**Lessons Learned:**\n\nAll the choices we make today shape our future. If you can truly delay gratification you are setting your self up for a much brighter and successful life. If you are constantly giving into your desires for a quick dopamine hit your future will be less than it could have been.",

Our identity does the same in reverse.  \n\nWhen you decide upon improving yourself, whether you start by eating healthier, working out, cold showers...\nyou should aim for attaining an identity of someone who eats healthy, who works out, who takes cold showers, not necessarily the act itself.\n\nThis is so because, our ego is our biggest factor of motivation for keeping or developing habits. If you perceive yourself in a certain way, you will subconsciously strive to do what makes you remain that way, which is why breaking bad habits is so hard. You are comprised of them (good or bad) \n\nMost important thing to keep in mind is to have patience and not get discouraged by not seeing immediate results. If you workout once, twice and so on you have to keep doing it until your identity catches up to your actions. When your identity catches up and you are a person who works out on a regular basis no strings attached, then it becomes automatic and requires little to no willpower.\n\nAlso don't get dissapointed if you for example have developed a healthy habit of working out, but can't seem to do work/study consistently or whatever else. Each habit requires it's own growing and nurturing, but a carryover effect is real.  Make your life a rolling ball of compounding quality healthy habits and don't go in all at once, start small.",

These people are required to go into work just to stamp documents.  Someone in that sub asked \"can't they bring the stamp home?\", which lead to the following response:  \n\n>A question that only someone thats never lived in Japan would ask.\n\n>There doesnt need to be any practical or logical reason for a rule\n\n>Rules no matter how trivial are followed without question\n\n>People actually go into a sort of shock if you violate a rule\n\n>For example my wife once tried to order hot takeaway milk from a Mr Donuts.\n\n>The server explained that you can takeaway coffee etc but not hot milk because you might not drink it right away and it could go bad and then make you sick. Long nonsense discussion\n\n>My wife proceeds to order a hot milk to eat there and asks for an empty takeaway cup. At this point we assumed the server knew what was going to happen next because she gave my wife the milk and the cup without question and there really was only one explanation for wanting the empty cup.\n\n>When my wife poured the milk into the cup the server said something like ah ahh ooh ee-ee-eah and then remained totally motionless for what seemed like 2 minutes. We were concerned asked if she was OK and she just nodded.\n\n>The sort of rule breaking that my wife just did literally doesnt ever happen in Japan.\n\n\nThis absolutely blew my mind.\n\nApparently following rules is so burned into their culture, that they wouldn't even consider breaking even minor rules.  \n\nAnother comment in the same thread mentions how you can't even order an omelette without rice.  You have to order the omelette with rice, then throw the rice out while the server stares in disbelief .\n\n\n>Then my wife poured the milk into the cup the server said something like ah ahh ooh ee-ee-eah and then remained totally motionless for what seemed like 2 minutes. We were concerned asked if she was OK and she just nodded.\n\n\nWhich got me thinking about the blue pill \"rules\" here in north america in context to the red pill (get a gf, get married, get her pregnant, pay her cash and prizes when she's ready to move on, and don't you dare deviate from that path you fucking sonofabitch!).\n\n\nI realized our ability to say \"fuck this I'm gonna spin plates, avoid marriage, enjoy the decline, etc\" results in the same \"ah ahh ooh ee-ee-eah short-circuiting in blue pill programmed individuals.\n\n.\n\n\n\"Seducter, you can't fuck her, she's married!  ah ahh ooh ee-ee-eah\n\n.\n\n\nNot only did I fuck her, but I sent her ass home to the husband who's cooking supper for her and the kids.\n\n\nJust seeing that comment thread made me really appreciate the freedom that we have.  To be able to break free from society's conditioning and do what we want.  Imagine freezing up in a firestorm of cultural programming and indecisiveness because someone asked you if they could borrow your shovel.\n\n\nThank fuck for the red pill.",

You're an alpha recovering from a fucking disease!Today I had a fucking epiphany.\n\nI've always thought of myself, deep down in my subconcious, as a beta. No matter what I was trying to do, I was a beta, because I was thinking so of myself.\n\nI made some money... still a beta, cause why not? I somehow fucked some girls... still a beta, cause why not? Worked out, dieted, turned my body into a fucking anciet greek sculpture... still a beta in my mind, cause why not?\n\nNo matter what I did, I was a beta. No matter how better I got and how much I advanced, I was still a beta and I was to remain a beta, whatever great achievement I might've had.\n\n**Because I was brainwashed into it!**\n\nThis my simple epiphany. We are brainwashed by the society to think very lowly of ourselves, the government wants us as manipulable as possible, so they instill these thoughts in us ever since we're kids.\n\nWe, as men, we naturally are alphas, thanks to our biology, thanks to our dick, balls and endocrine system and thanks to our anatomy, we're BUILT BY NATURE to conquer, or at least to relentlessly try to conquer as best as possible.\n\nThere's not one single motherfucker out there, who's a natural born beta, there isn't such a thing.\n\nThink of it this way: you start out as an alpha by nature the moment you're born, and your anatomy is there to confirm it. Then, with each passing day, society, friends, family, the government, the massmedia, social media, start fucking with you, a little here, a little there while you're growing up, instilling certain retarded, against your nature thoughts in your brain, which don't benefit you, but benefits them, until you forget your true, masculine, animalistic, conquering nature, thus, you become a little puppet.\n\nThis is why you always feel an interior conflict, this is why usually you feel anxiety and depression. You KNOW who you are, deep down. You very well know what the fuck you feel like doing and saying, there's a little voice and instinct in your head that you feel like you should follow because it's gonna turn out good. But just before starting to follow that instinct, you start thinking... \"but what if he thinks I'm a weirdo cause I didn't laught at his joke? Better start fake laughing\", \"but what if she thinks that I'm not a good boy that she can trust, better not tell her how retarded she sounds\", that's the voice of your fake beta that has been instilled in you, taking over your natural alpha instincts.\n\nRetarded ideologies which go against rationality and biology: feminism, gay acceptance, veganism, fat acceptance.\n\nCheap pleasures such as: 24/7 pornography, junk food, sugar, on demand pointless entertainment (netflix, youtube, tik tok).\n\nStupid bandaids: anti-depressive pills, pushing any sort of medicine down your throat, getting you addicted to xanax and all that shit.\n\nMind games: the purposeful lack of certain education, the purposeful miseducation in some areas, slave 9-5 working making you believe you're a champion, meanwhile you're making some other dude rich.\n\nThey want you to be a mindless zombie.  \"Don't brag, be humble\" \"Stop judging people\" \"Accept them for who they are\". They want you to have no personality. To be like a falling leaf, floating in whatever direction the wind blows.\n\nThey feed you cheap pleasures. Junk food. Stupid entertainment. Crap medicine.  Filling your brain with cheap dopamine.  Keeping you docile, like a tranquiliezed lion in a cage.\n\nYou think you're a good man, because you believe in God, you go to work, you get your monthly salary, you fuck your wife and raise your kids, which you do... but you're doing it on their terms. You're not free, you're theirs, until you break out of this mental pattern.\n\nFuck them.  The only way out of the cage is by forming your OWN opinions.  You don't like fat people? Good, me neither, fuck them, fat shame them until they lose weight.  You don't like hobos? Good, me neither, fuck them, they should go to work and not beg like some losers.\n\nSTAND FOR SOMETHING.  If you don't stand for something, any fucking thing at all, there's gonna be an empty spot inside you waiting to be filled.  It's gonna be filled by something else and someone else, unless YOU FILL IT FOR YOURSELF.\n\nYou're not a beta trying to become alpha. You're an alpha recovering from a fucking disease!",

Unhappily they dont wear little, feminine sub girl pins.  You have to do the work.  \n\nI have previously written about **[Submissive Women](https://archive.is/wdn37)** - How to lead when she wants to follow  and this post is a follow up about gaming submissive women.  \nSo lets assume that you went back and re-read my first post on submissive girls, and you know some of the tells: Shes tall (more pronounced submission starts near 58 (172CM or so) and by 510 (178CM) it is a *LOCK*), shes feminine, shes intelligent, shes introverted, shes feminist (this can be a bit of a put on) and (one I didnt mention in the prior piece): she has a responsible job  under the current cultural narrative, women have to *reject* marriage and family and go work like men, only not as well, and with a lot more complaining about how hard they are working.  What we do as men isnt easy.  When they are expected to do the same thing they find it difficult (just as things they do in their natural roles would seem difficult, or at least a pain in the ass, to us.)  My primary slave girl is a doctor.  When shes at mine, the last thing she wants to do is have to make a decision.  If I take her out to dinner (Im an extrovert and sometimes like such things) I order for her off of the menu.  If the womens study major taking our order looks at her for confirmation she will say *He knows what I like.*  And I do.\n\n**Gaming Submissive Girls**\n\nKeep the vibe mildly subversive, and flirty, like its all in fun.  Try on some light teasing.  **Submissive girls are not always aware of their nature, but when they are, they are very often TERRIFIED of it, because they feel vulnerable, which is understandable.**  Many a truth was first spoken in jest.  You want to make her feel comfortable with you, so that her natural submissive nature will be easier for her to express.  Sometimes girls wind up feeling relieved.  \n\nIf she shit test you over *Muh EQUALISM! or *Muh FEMINISM!*, simply say *I think the sexes each have roles to which they are better suited than the other.*  Then STFU.  If she pursue it you can go on with *Then why dont women take labor jobs at an equal rate as men?  Not many female plumbers, masons or construction workers  other than the occasional butch lesbian affirmative action hire who holds the SLOW sign?*    If she says  and sometimes they are totally blind to it - *But men are bigger and stronger and* You: *So you agree with me then that there are roles to which each sex is better suited.*  Then change the topic.  You have planted the seed that you are not the typical Male Feminist or Ally or whatever bullshit that is going to try and SIMP his way into her pussy.  Those things, along with being a Nice Guy^TM or a White Knight^TM are just alternative pussy-getting strategies that Do.Not.Work.  \n\nI do not hide my ~~Cro Mag~~ patriarchal views because I want feminine, submissive women to hear them, because those are the women I am interested in developing ongoing, mutually-pleasurable sexual relationships with.  I am usually quite good at *repartee* but if I am at a loss for words I say something that is sexist, but funny.  It cant be awful, like how women are shit, etc.  you shouldnt be thinking that at all, you should be finding girls who are your female complement  but it can be something like *You just reminded me why women should be FELT and not HEARD.*  \n\n*But Uncle Vasya!  Isnt that SEXIST?!*  Well, yes it is, but thats the point.  Women understand that, in male hierarchies, there is room for everyone, from the highest to the lowest  it is women who exclude, who ostracize, attack reputations etc.  so more often than not girls say things to me such as *You are arrogant, but in a good way,* or *I hate how much I like you!*  or better yet, *\"No guy has ever talked to me like this before!\"*  That is their Hamster telling me that Im on track  and that's the secret: **Some guys give it Hamster Chow; I give the Hamster cocaine.** Get them talking about their fantasies, put them into action. \n \n**Chatting Her Up.**\n\n**Kino is Key.**  Physicalize things early.  Do not underestimate the power or touch.  One thing I will do when it is appropriate is to lift a girl up of her feet in a hug.  Sometimes I will do this with one arm.  I have had girls tell me they like it because they *know they are being held by a man.*  You are communicating with her hindbrain, and what you are telling it is, *I am a strong, masculine man.*  A woman who was my girlfriend in the Long Ago liked to be on the receiving end of bear hugs.  Like she wanted me to try and crush her-type bear hugs.  She flat out told me, *I like to feel how strong you are.*\n\n**Display dominance.**  If you are taking a girl out on a date you need to communicate two things to her: what time to be ready, and what the dress code is.  By this time, as I will have established my *bona fides* as a ~~sexist pig~~ patriarchal guy, I will say something like *So, I will be wearing {X}.  Dress how fashionable young ladies dress when men are wearing {X}.*^1  If a girl asks if you want help plan the date, squint like you just heard her say something silly and then say, *No.  I am the man, and you are the girl.  I will plan the date.*^2  Ive had girls say something like *Oh, thank God!*  Its a relief to them.  There is a societal narrative that they are supposed to be like little men, which neither they, nor we, should want.  \n\nI also will toss in, if Im feeling it, with respect to dress code: *And be sure to wear pretty underwear for me.* Now, bloopers and betafags will get the vapors and howl, *Eeww!  That is so CRINGE!!!* but thats why they are bloopers and betafags.  They shame men for doing Masculine Things.  Should those asshats be making up rules for you?  Fuck^NO!  You wanna know what that line results in most often?  Pretty underwear.  That I get to see.  And remove.  Except the one time that it resulted in no underwear, because that particular filly thought I might *like that better.*  Fair point to her.  It gets the hamster spinning, even if she says *Me no likey!* her Hamster is thinking, *What an asshole!  How dare he! I should put on my favorite, sexiest pair, just in case I want to flash him at dinner!*  Her hindbrain should have recognize you as a Masculine Man by this time and want to please you.  \n\nAs an aside, Ive had some young TRPers say this over text to girls who then give them the *I just want to be clear that I am just coming over to Netflix and Chill as Friendsblah blah.*  The guys then reach out to me for advice  *What should I say?!*  the answer to which is (a) just ignore and reply *Sure.  Be here at 8pm* or whatever is topical, and (b) dont listen to what they say, watch what they do.  Those girls were just throwing up ASD, and the guys later closed via isolation and escalation.\n\n**The Coup De Grace**  If I find I am chatting up a real sub girl and I get her hamster spinning, I will drop this line on her.  If its public, I might whisper it in her ear:\n\n*I know your secret.*\n\nThen I STFU and let the hamster wheel spin.  Played correctly, this line *SLAYS*.  How so? She will immediately want to know, *What secret?!*  Give her a sly look and say, *You  know, your secret.*  She will continue to try to pry it out of you.  Say, *You know.  The one you have tried to hide all of your life.*  Later I will add, *But dont worry, {sing-song voice} Ill ne-ver te-ell {/sing-song voice}.*  {Discretion is, ofc, **MANDATORY**.}\n\nI have even had girls ask, me in a state of post-coital bliss, how I knew.  Me: *Little spoons dont ask questions.*^3  Another typical reply, *I am a hunter.  I know my prey.*  That makes the hindbrain send a jolt of electricity straight to the puss.  \n\nNow, there are certainly women who will not respond to this type of gaming either because they arent particularly submissive, have not come to terms with it, I am too old for them or I do not meet their SMV requirements.  Thats perfectly fine.  Im not trying to force a bad fit.  Nobody, least of all me, wants an **[Anna Karenina Problem](http://archive.is/2uHuU)**  I want to vet girls who I find attractive to find those who want the same things that I want.  Those that do not I am happy to release back into the SMP to go and find what they want.\nOne of the more important things you have to learn is to find the Pool of Girls who are attracted to you and draw dates/plates/mates from that pool.  I don't try to \"force\" a bad match because I *reeeeeeally* want to bang a particular girl.  The key to that is abundance.  I am also not trying to project my own \"Disney\" fantasy onto a girl.  I vet them and the ones who I want to bang who are into what I'm into?  I simply give them what they want.  And to get it all that they have to give me is ... *everything.*\n\n**Takeaways**\n\n-Submissive girls are fun.\n\n-Vet your girls properly for their enjoyment and yours.  Keep the vibe flirty, fun and mildly subversive.\n\n-Not every girl is going to walk this path.  Release those back into the wild.  \n\n-With girls who dig this vibe, **[the Rewards Will Be Great](http://archive.is/09rQG).**\n\n-Your options will increase as you work to **[Become the Prize](http://archive.is/ZM7zX)**\n\n^1  In talking this over the modern dating environment with a woman I had met socially, but wasnt actively chatting up with an eye toward bedding, she responded to me saying essentially this is how I roll with *Wow.  Thats really dominant.* Her telling me that would be what is known in the investigation business as a clue.\n\n^2  Keep things loose, with some structure, but a back-up plan in case something changes (the weather sucks or whatever).  Dont over plan.  \n\n^3  Mild condescension is ok.  Going full-on Asshole is not likely going to get you over the goal line with the type of girl we are talking about.  Guys who say things like *I implemented TRP and now people think Im an asshole,* overdid.  Younglings havent learned to Wield The Power, yet.",

Unhappily they dont wear little, feminine sub girl pins.  You have to do the work.  \n\nI have previously written about **[Submissive Women](https://archive.is/wdn37)** - How to lead when she wants to follow  and this post is a follow up about gaming submissive women.  \nSo lets assume that you went back and re-read my first post on submissive girls, and you know some of the tells: Shes tall (more pronounced submission starts near 58 (172CM or so) and by 510 (178CM) it is a *LOCK*), shes feminine, shes intelligent, shes introverted, shes feminist (this can be a bit of a put on) and (one I didnt mention in the prior piece): she has a responsible job  under the current cultural narrative, women have to *reject* marriage and family and go work like men, only not as well, and with a lot more complaining about how hard they are working.  What we do as men isnt easy.  When they are expected to do the same thing they find it difficult (just as things they do in their natural roles would seem difficult, or at least a pain in the ass, to us.)  My primary slave girl is a doctor.  When shes at mine, the last thing she wants to do is have to make a decision.  If I take her out to dinner (Im an extrovert and sometimes like such things) I order for her off of the menu.  If the womens study major taking our order looks at her for confirmation she will say *He knows what I like.*  And I do.\n\n**Gaming Submissive Girls**\n\nKeep the vibe mildly subversive, and flirty, like its all in fun.  Try on some light teasing.  **Submissive girls are not always aware of their nature, but when they are, they are very often TERRIFIED of it, because they feel vulnerable, which is understandable.**  Many a truth was first spoken in jest.  You want to make her feel comfortable with you, so that her natural submissive nature will be easier for her to express.  Sometimes girls wind up feeling relieved.  \n\nIf she shit test you over *Muh EQUALISM! or *Muh FEMINISM!*, simply say *I think the sexes each have roles to which they are better suited than the other.*  Then STFU.  If she pursue it you can go on with *Then why dont women take labor jobs at an equal rate as men?  Not many female plumbers, masons or construction workers  other than the occasional butch lesbian affirmative action hire who holds the SLOW sign?*    If she says  and sometimes they are totally blind to it - *But men are bigger and stronger and* You: *So you agree with me then that there are roles to which each sex is better suited.*  Then change the topic.  You have planted the seed that you are not the typical Male Feminist or Ally or whatever bullshit that is going to try and SIMP his way into her pussy.  Those things, along with being a Nice Guy^TM or a White Knight^TM are just alternative pussy-getting strategies that Do.Not.Work.  \n\nI do not hide my ~~Cro Mag~~ patriarchal views because I want feminine, submissive women to hear them, because those are the women I am interested in developing ongoing, mutually-pleasurable sexual relationships with.  I am usually quite good at *repartee* but if I am at a loss for words I say something that is sexist, but funny.  It cant be awful, like how women are shit, etc.  you shouldnt be thinking that at all, you should be finding girls who are your female complement  but it can be something like *You just reminded me why women should be FELT and not HEARD.*  \n\n*But Uncle Vasya!  Isnt that SEXIST?!*  Well, yes it is, but thats the point.  Women understand that, in male hierarchies, there is room for everyone, from the highest to the lowest  it is women who exclude, who ostracize, attack reputations etc.  so more often than not girls say things to me such as *You are arrogant, but in a good way,* or *I hate how much I like you!*  or better yet, *\"No guy has ever talked to me like this before!\"*  That is their Hamster telling me that Im on track  and that's the secret: **Some guys give it Hamster Chow; I give the Hamster cocaine.** Get them talking about their fantasies, put them into action. \n \n**Chatting Her Up.**\n\n**Kino is Key.**  Physicalize things early.  Do not underestimate the power or touch.  One thing I will do when it is appropriate is to lift a girl up of her feet in a hug.  Sometimes I will do this with one arm.  I have had girls tell me they like it because they *know they are being held by a man.*  You are communicating with her hindbrain, and what you are telling it is, *I am a strong, masculine man.*  A woman who was my girlfriend in the Long Ago liked to be on the receiving end of bear hugs.  Like she wanted me to try and crush her-type bear hugs.  She flat out told me, *I like to feel how strong you are.*\n\n**Display dominance.**  If you are taking a girl out on a date you need to communicate two things to her: what time to be ready, and what the dress code is.  By this time, as I will have established my *bona fides* as a ~~sexist pig~~ patriarchal guy, I will say something like *So, I will be wearing {X}.  Dress how fashionable young ladies dress when men are wearing {X}.*^1  If a girl asks if you want help plan the date, squint like you just heard her say something silly and then say, *No.  I am the man, and you are the girl.  I will plan the date.*^2  Ive had girls say something like *Oh, thank God!*  Its a relief to them.  There is a societal narrative that they are supposed to be like little men, which neither they, nor we, should want.  \n\nI also will toss in, if Im feeling it, with respect to dress code: *And be sure to wear pretty underwear for me.* Now, bloopers and betafags will get the vapors and howl, *Eeww!  That is so CRINGE!!!* but thats why they are bloopers and betafags.  They shame men for doing Masculine Things.  Should those asshats be making up rules for you?  Fuck^NO!  You wanna know what that line results in most often?  Pretty underwear.  That I get to see.  And remove.  Except the one time that it resulted in no underwear, because that particular filly thought I might *like that better.*  Fair point to her.  It gets the hamster spinning, even if she says *Me no likey!* her Hamster is thinking, *What an asshole!  How dare he! I should put on my favorite, sexiest pair, just in case I want to flash him at dinner!*  Her hindbrain should have recognize you as a Masculine Man by this time and want to please you.  \n\nAs an aside, Ive had some young TRPers say this over text to girls who then give them the *I just want to be clear that I am just coming over to Netflix and Chill as Friendsblah blah.*  The guys then reach out to me for advice  *What should I say?!*  the answer to which is (a) just ignore and reply *Sure.  Be here at 8pm* or whatever is topical, and (b) dont listen to what they say, watch what they do.  Those girls were just throwing up ASD, and the guys later closed via isolation and escalation.\n\n**The Coup De Grace**  If I find I am chatting up a real sub girl and I get her hamster spinning, I will drop this line on her.  If its public, I might whisper it in her ear:\n\n*I know your secret.*\n\nThen I STFU and let the hamster wheel spin.  Played correctly, this line *SLAYS*.  How so? She will immediately want to know, *What secret?!*  Give her a sly look and say, *You  know, your secret.*  She will continue to try to pry it out of you.  Say, *You know.  The one you have tried to hide all of your life.*  Later I will add, *But dont worry, {sing-song voice} Ill ne-ver te-ell {/sing-song voice}.*  {Discretion is, ofc, **MANDATORY**.}\n\nI have even had girls ask, me in a state of post-coital bliss, how I knew.

Unhappily they dont wear little, feminine sub girl pins.  You have to do the work.  \n\nI have previously written about **[Submissive Women](https://archive.is/wdn37)** - How to lead when she wants to follow  and this post is a follow up about gaming submissive women.  \nSo lets assume that you went back and re-read my first post on submissive girls, and you know some of the tells: Shes tall (more pronounced submission starts near 58 (172CM or so) and by 510 (178CM) it is a *LOCK*), shes feminine, shes intelligent, shes introverted, shes feminist (this can be a bit of a put on) and (one I didnt mention in the prior piece): she has a responsible job  under the current cultural narrative, women have to *reject* marriage and family and go work like men, only not as well, and with a lot more complaining about how hard they are working.  What we do as men isnt easy.  When they are expected to do the same thing they find it difficult (just as things they do in their natural roles would seem difficult, or at least a pain in the ass, to us.)  My primary slave girl is a doctor.  When shes at mine, the last thing she wants to do is have to make a decision.  If I take her out to dinner (Im an extrovert and sometimes like such things) I order for her off of the menu.  If the womens study major taking our order looks at her for confirmation she will say *He knows what I like.*  And I do.\n\n**Gaming Submissive Girls**\n\nKeep the vibe mildly subversive, and flirty, like its all in fun.  Try on some light teasing.  **Submissive girls are not always aware of their nature, but when they are, they are very often TERRIFIED of it, because they feel vulnerable, which is understandable.**  Many a truth was first spoken in jest.  You want to make her feel comfortable with you, so that her natural submissive nature will be easier for her to express.  Sometimes girls wind up feeling relieved.  \n\nIf she shit test you over *Muh EQUALISM! or *Muh FEMINISM!*, simply say *I think the sexes each have roles to which they are better suited than the other.*  Then STFU.  If she pursue it you can go on with *Then why dont women take labor jobs at an equal rate as men?  Not many female plumbers, masons or construction workers  other than the occasional butch lesbian affirmative action hire who holds the SLOW sign?*    If she says  and sometimes they are totally blind to it - *But men are bigger and stronger and* You: *So you agree with me then that there are roles to which each sex is better suited.*  Then change the topic.  You have planted the seed that you are not the typical Male Feminist or Ally or whatever bullshit that is going to try and SIMP his way into her pussy.  Those things, along with being a Nice Guy^TM or a White Knight^TM are just alternative pussy-getting strategies that Do.Not.Work.  \n\nI do not hide my ~~Cro Mag~~ patriarchal views because I want feminine, submissive women to hear them, because those are the women I am interested in developing ongoing, mutually-pleasurable sexual relationships with.  I am usually quite good at *repartee* but if I am at a loss for words I say something that is sexist, but funny.  It cant be awful, like how women are shit, etc.  you shouldnt be thinking that at all, you should be finding girls who are your female complement  but it can be something like *You just reminded me why women should be FELT and not HEARD.*  \n\n*But Uncle Vasya!  Isnt that SEXIST?!*  Well, yes it is, but thats the point.  Women understand that, in male hierarchies, there is room for everyone, from the highest to the lowest  it is women who exclude, who ostracize, attack reputations etc.  so more often than not girls say things to me such as *You are arrogant, but in a good way,* or *I hate how much I like you!*  or better yet, *\"No guy has ever talked to me like this before!\"*  That is their Hamster telling me that Im on track  and that's the secret: **Some guys give it Hamster Chow; I give the Hamster cocaine.** Get them talking about their fantasies, put them into action. \n \n**Chatting Her Up.**\n\n**Kino is Key.**  Physicalize things early.  Do not underestimate the power or touch.  One thing I will do when it is appropriate is to lift a girl up of her feet in a hug.  Sometimes I will do this with one arm.  I have had girls tell me they like it because they *know they are being held by a man.*  You are communicating with her hindbrain, and what you are telling it is, *I am a strong, masculine man.*  A woman who was my girlfriend in the Long Ago liked to be on the receiving end of bear hugs.  Like she wanted me to try and crush her-type bear hugs.  She flat out told me, *I like to feel how strong you are.*\n\n**Display dominance.**  If you are taking a girl out on a date you need to communicate two things to her: what time to be ready, and what the dress code is.  By this time, as I will have established my *bona fides* as a ~~sexist pig~~ patriarchal guy, I will say something like *So, I will be wearing {X}.  Dress how fashionable young ladies dress when men are wearing {X}.*^1  If a girl asks if you want help plan the date, squint like you just heard her say something silly and then say, *No.  I am the man, and you are the girl.  I will plan the date.*^2  Ive had girls say something like *Oh, thank God!*  Its a relief to them.  There is a societal narrative that they are supposed to be like little men, which neither they, nor we, should want.  \n\nI also will toss in, if Im feeling it, with respect to dress code: *And be sure to wear pretty underwear for me.* Now, bloopers and betafags will get the vapors and howl, *Eeww!  That is so CRINGE!!!* but thats why they are bloopers and betafags.  They shame men for doing Masculine Things.  Should those asshats be making up rules for you?  Fuck^NO!  You wanna know what that line results in most often?  Pretty underwear.  That I get to see.  And remove.  Except the one time that it resulted in no underwear, because that particular filly thought I might *like that better.*  Fair point to her.  It gets the hamster spinning, even if she says *Me no likey!* her Hamster is thinking, *What an asshole!  How dare he! I should put on my favorite, sexiest pair, just in case I want to flash him at dinner!*  Her hindbrain should have recognize you as a Masculine Man by this time and want to please you.  \n\nAs an aside, Ive had some young TRPers say this over text to girls who then give them the *I just want to be clear that I am just coming over to Netflix and Chill as Friendsblah blah.*  The guys then reach out to me for advice  *What should I say?!*  the answer to which is (a) just ignore and reply *Sure.  Be here at 8pm* or whatever is topical, and (b) dont listen to what they say, watch what they do.  Those girls were just throwing up ASD, and the guys later closed via isolation and escalation.\n\n**The Coup De Grace**  If I find I am chatting up a real sub girl and I get her hamster spinning, I will drop this line on her.  If its public, I might whisper it in her ear:\n\n*I know your secret.*\n\nThen I STFU and let the hamster wheel spin.  Played correctly, this line *SLAYS*.  How so? She will immediately want to know, *What secret?!*  Give her a sly look and say, *You  know, your secret.*  She will continue to try to pry it out of you.  Say, *You know.  The one you have tried to hide all of your life.*  Later I will add, *But dont worry, {sing-song voice} Ill ne-ver te-ell {/sing-song voice}.*  {Discretion is, ofc, **MANDATORY**.}\n\nI have even had girls ask, me in a state of post-coital bliss, how I knew.  Me: *Little spoons dont ask questions.*^3  Another typical reply, *I am a hunter.  I know my prey.*  That makes the hindbrain send a jolt of electricity straight to the puss.  \n\nNow, there are certainly women who will not respond to this type of gaming either because they arent particularly submissive, have not come to terms with it, I am too old for them or I do not meet their SMV requirements.

I don't try to \"force\" a bad match because I *reeeeeeally* want to bang a particular girl.  The key to that is abundance.  I am also not trying to project my own \"Disney\" fantasy onto a girl.  I vet them and the ones who I want to bang who are into what I'm into?  I simply give them what they want.  And to get it all that they have to give me is ... *everything.*\n\n**Takeaways**\n\n-Submissive girls are fun.\n\n-Vet your girls properly for their enjoyment and yours.  Keep the vibe flirty, fun and mildly subversive.\n\n-Not every girl is going to walk this path.  Release those back into the wild.  \n\n-With girls who dig this vibe, **[the Rewards Will Be Great](http://archive.is/09rQG).**\n\n-Your options will increase as you work to **[Become the Prize](http://archive.is/ZM7zX)**\n\n^1  In talking this over the modern dating environment with a woman I had met socially, but wasnt actively chatting up with an eye toward bedding, she responded to me saying essentially this is how I roll with *Wow.  Thats really dominant.* Her telling me that would be what is known in the investigation business as a clue.\n\n^2  Keep things loose, with some structure, but a back-up plan in case something changes (the weather sucks or whatever).  Dont over plan.  \n\n^3  Mild condescension is ok.  Going full-on Asshole is not likely going to get you over the goal line with the type of girl we are talking about.  Guys who say things like *I implemented TRP and now people think Im an asshole,* overdid.  Younglings havent learned to Wield The Power, yet.",

And you likely had to go somewhere in person to acquire it which in itself might have prevented you for fear of embarrassment.   \n\nAccess to porn and what is available has become too powerful.  \n\nI remember growing up in the 90's. My friends and I stumbled upon a magazine stash at a nearby construction site. We thought we had just found gold. We each took one of the magazines home.. and guarded it like the One True Ring.   \n\nFast forward a few years later and those same friends and I are trading floppy disks that could hold a few pictures or maybe 1-2 video clips of 3 or 4 seconds.   \n\nThen a few years later broadband internet starting coming out and was available in my neighborhoods. Back then we called it \"cable internet.\" File sharing programs were popular for downloading MP3s but they were also gigantic repositories for adult material. You could type in a search string and click download all. A few hours later you'd have tons and tons of video material.   \n\nThen the streaming sites came and we have today's version of modern porn access.   \n\nI realize many of you might not have a problem with porn. I myself have been able to suppress my use of it. But we are here to help other men. A lot of the guys that read this site are young and might be struggling with this. I used to struggle before I knew I was struggling with it.  \n\nAt this point I believe porn is a weapon being used to subdue the desires and passions of millions of men around the world. Think about it. There is a reason why Russia and China both have laws banning the production of it. These are our rivals... and they must be laughing knowing Americans and Westerners are mostly subdued by this degeneracy. Blowing their loads into tissues and draining themselves of their testosterone on a nightly basis.   \n\nAs someone who has used Porn while in an LTR and then stopped using it there is a big difference in sexual pleasure once you abstain. Death Grip is real and makes real sex less pleasurable. Once you beat death grip sex will feel like losing your virginity every time. If you're not whacking it often you won't be suffering from death grip but it is real for those whacking it on a nightly basis.   \n\nAnd for those who think approaching women is not worth it... That's likely your opinion because you have an outlet for your desires. Take that outlet away and your sexual drive will take off like a rocket ship and you will inevitably become good at cold-approach because you will have no other choice.  \n\nThere is no shame in admitting you might have a problem and there are tools that can help. Porn blocking tools exist and work in multiple ways. Of course they can't stop you on every single device you own so you'll need some discipline.  \n\nThe NoFap community on this website and other places is also very helpful for support and questions.  \n\nOther men will literally jump in a cold shower in the first few days of abstaining if they must.  \n\nThere is no shame if you have been a victim of this.  \n\nAgain, not all of you will be in this position. You might be enjoying a good porn-laced whack every now and then and that's fine. And some of you might already know that you can whack it without porn entirely and its much healthier for you. I'm definitely not advocating for pure noFap forever. Just don't let it get out of control. Build your power and testosterone by keeping it in your balls for a week or so before release if you're by yourself.  \n\nAnd remember, dating use app is on the rise even on lock-down. Women are horny and alone and want a man to get in bed with them regardless of the local rules of social-distance in place.\n\nLessons learned:  \n\n\\-My opinion on Porn is that it is a tool used by rival governments to hurt the men of The West.  \n\n\\-Death grip is real and comes from nightly porn use. It will prevent you from feeling maximum pleasure when having sex.  \n\n\\-Daily use of Porn is hurting your motivation to speak to women and form relationships.  \n\n\\-Tools exist to prevent or curb porn use and there are other methods you can do to help in the form of distracting yourself.    \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSources: \n\nPorn laws by country -- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pornography\\_laws\\_by\\_region  \n\nPorn Blockers -- https://listoffreeware.com/free-porn-blocker-software-windows/  \n\nTinder use is way up! -- https://www.foxbusiness.com/lifestyle/tinder-surpasses-bumble-okcupid-hinge-in-coronavirus-lockdown",

But you know what? Good for the rest of us. I am in my 40s, I have seen quite a bit, and I can tell you than women nowadays dont get enough attention. Back in the days, men would chase women and we were ready to do anything for you know what. Women would get annoyed by our horniness, and we would get accused of being only interested in sex. This is not happening anymore, and it is very distressing for women. It has considerably changed the balance of power. I have seen women in awe with my dick just because I could raise it, something which at any other time in history would have just been the normal. They would tell me of all their past dates that could not perform, and then they would just worship my dick and giving me anything I wanted just for being hard. Thats something I would not have seen 20 years ago. Sometimes, just being a bit bold and showing sexual interest is enough to get laid. It is a bit sad for women, as their needs do not get to be fulfilled, but it is also a fantastic time to live in if you dont watch porn and can maintain a normal sexuality!!",

Youll feel fulfilled whether you fuck her or not and you can stop hamstering about whether she wants you or not.**\n\nWeve all had this experience. Youre talking to a bitch and you really want to say some nasty, crude, downright vile shit to her. You want to tell her about how shes gonna choke on your unborn children, how youre gonna ass-fuck her so hard shes gonna be wincing in pain whenever she sits down, how you cant wait to see her in handcuffs begging for mercy...but you dont out of fear. Fear of offending her, fear of offending the masses, fear of something. \n\n**This fear is the result of social conditioning. Since day one youve been born into a liberal-feminist society that has taught you to suppress and run from your primal instinct. This suppression ruined your primal game and turned you into a meek beta-cuck wage slave begging and waiting for pittance and post-wall yeast-infected pussy.**\n\nI could go on about how society as a whole is a direct result of our masculine instinct being suppressed, but youre not here for that; youre here to find out how you can use your masculine instinct to shove your meat dragon into an Asian girls dumpling over and over again until she drips soy sauce.\n\nThe next time youre chatting with a bitch you need to turn your brain off. Stop thinking so damn much and speak from, and with, your gut. Chances are, your brain is still poisoned by the propaganda weve been force-fed since we came out of our mothers vagina. Your brain holds you back when it comes to primal matters, especially sex. Your brain is trying to balance your urges as a man and what our degenerate, decaying society wants of you, so turn that shit off and trust your gut.\n\nHeres the catch; you have to absolutely mean what you say and have the frame to back it up. This is TRP101, but this bears repeating. You cant be some high-pitched nerd saying to an HB9\n\n*y-y-y-yeah g-url Im gonna f-f-f-uck you with my lego death star you...uhhh...dirty slut!*\n\nThis doesnt mean you go around breaking the core tenets of TRP. Dont go around telling your co-worker that she's eating your raw meat tonight. Don't tell your boss that you want to use her paperweight as a butt-plug and fuck her on her desk. Dont shit where you eat and please, for the love of God, dont say this type of shit to the fat blue-haired feminist liberal dykes that frequent The Blue Pill subreddit.  I want you to catch STDs, not court cases.\n\nIm going to give you an example to drive my point home. One where I fail so I can keep the post short and you can learn something from my mistake. Yes, my shit stinks too.\n\nA while ago I was trying to fuck this small little Filipina that couldnt have weighed more than 115 pounds. We met through a former roommate of mine but I got her number and stayed in touch. We were out one day and she commented on how I looked bigger and stronger since wed last met. I said the first thing that came to me without hesitation...\n\n**Yeah, I could probably pick your tiny ass up and throw you around like a little ragdoll. I could have fun with you.**\n\nThe look on her face was psychotic, animalistic, primordial. She smiled an ear to ear smile and her eyes widened. When a woman truly wants you its not like the sexy, nail-biting shit you see in movies; its downright psychotic. I made the mistake of letting my surprise for her reaction show. She sensed my surprise and I dried her pussy up like the California droughts. Whoops. \n\nNotice how the line wasn't even a good one. I could have said something a lot smoother, but I didn't, I said the first thing that came to me and it worked all the same instead of hamstering and looking for \"the right thing to say\" or \"the best line.\" \n\nI took note of this and decided to say the first thing that came to me and to hold frame from then on. This attitude and embracement of my primal sexuality turned my dating life around completely. My success rate skyrocketed, but so did my rejections. Either way, I was happy at the end of the day because I was either balls deep in a bitch or I knew for certain that a woman was not interested in me. No guessing games, no hamstering, I either got a new notch in my belt or a solid rejection. \n\nSo the next time you're sitting on your ass wondering what to text a bitch or your mind is racing at 9000 miles an hour trying to figure out what to say to the bitch in front of you... stop. Just say what comes to you from your primal masculine energy and stop thinking so damn much, but make sure you say it with some **balls.**\n\n\nTakeaways\n\n\n- Trust your gut more than your brain when gaming sluts. \n\n- HOLD FRAME WHEN SPEAKING YOUR GUT\n\n- Bitches love being wanted, so be proud of your sex drive and don't suppress it.\n\n- Speaking your gut will let you know for sure whether a bitch is interested in you or not. You don't have to guess and hamster anymore. \n\n- Raw, unapologetic, unrelenting sexuality will be noticed and craved.",

Youll feel fulfilled whether you fuck her or not and you can stop hamstering about whether she wants you or not.**\n\nWeve all had this experience. Youre talking to a bitch and you really want to say some nasty, crude, downright vile shit to her. You want to tell her about how shes gonna choke on your unborn children, how youre gonna ass-fuck her so hard shes gonna be wincing in pain whenever she sits down, how you cant wait to see her in handcuffs begging for mercy...but you dont out of fear. Fear of offending her, fear of offending the masses, fear of something. \n\n**This fear is the result of social conditioning. Since day one youve been born into a liberal-feminist society that has taught you to suppress and run from your primal instinct. This suppression ruined your primal game and turned you into a meek beta-cuck wage slave begging and waiting for pittance and post-wall yeast-infected pussy.**\n\nI could go on about how society as a whole is a direct result of our masculine instinct being suppressed, but youre not here for that; youre here to find out how you can use your masculine instinct to shove your meat dragon into an Asian girls dumpling over and over again until she drips soy sauce.\n\nThe next time youre chatting with a bitch you need to turn your brain off. Stop thinking so damn much and speak from, and with, your gut. Chances are, your brain is still poisoned by the propaganda weve been force-fed since we came out of our mothers vagina. Your brain holds you back when it comes to primal matters, especially sex. Your brain is trying to balance your urges as a man and what our degenerate, decaying society wants of you, so turn that shit off and trust your gut.\n\nHeres the catch; you have to absolutely mean what you say and have the frame to back it up. This is TRP101, but this bears repeating. You cant be some high-pitched nerd saying to an HB9\n\n*y-y-y-yeah g-url Im gonna f-f-f-uck you with my lego death star you...uhhh...dirty slut!*\n\nThis doesnt mean you go around breaking the core tenets of TRP. Dont go around telling your co-worker that she's eating your raw meat tonight. Don't tell your boss that you want to use her paperweight as a butt-plug and fuck her on her desk. Dont shit where you eat and please, for the love of God, dont say this type of shit to the fat blue-haired feminist liberal dykes that frequent The Blue Pill subreddit.  I want you to catch STDs, not court cases.\n\nIm going to give you an example to drive my point home. One where I fail so I can keep the post short and you can learn something from my mistake. Yes, my shit stinks too.\n\nA while ago I was trying to fuck this small little Filipina that couldnt have weighed more than 115 pounds. We met through a former roommate of mine but I got her number and stayed in touch. We were out one day and she commented on how I looked bigger and stronger since wed last met. I said the first thing that came to me without hesitation...\n\n**Yeah, I could probably pick your tiny ass up and throw you around like a little ragdoll. I could have fun with you.**\n\nThe look on her face was psychotic, animalistic, primordial. She smiled an ear to ear smile and her eyes widened. When a woman truly wants you its not like the sexy, nail-biting shit you see in movies; its downright psychotic. I made the mistake of letting my surprise for her reaction show. She sensed my surprise and I dried her pussy up like the California droughts. Whoops. \n\nNotice how the line wasn't even a good one. I could have said something a lot smoother, but I didn't, I said the first thing that came to me and it worked all the same instead of hamstering and looking for \"the right thing to say\" or \"the best line.\" \n\nI took note of this and decided to say the first thing that came to me and to hold frame from then on. This attitude and embracement of my primal sexuality turned my dating life around completely. My success rate skyrocketed, but so did my rejections. Either way, I was happy at the end of the day because I was either balls deep in a bitch or I knew for certain that a woman was not interested in me. No guessing games, no hamstering, I either got a new notch in my belt or a solid rejection. \n\nSo the next time you're sitting on your ass wondering what to text a bitch or your mind is racing at 9000 miles an hour trying to figure out what to say to the bitch in front of you... stop. Just say what comes to you from your primal masculine energy and stop thinking so damn much, but make sure you say it with some **balls.**\n\n\nTakeaways\n\n\n- Trust your gut more than your brain when gaming sluts. \n\n- HOLD FRAME WHEN SPEAKING YOUR GUT\n\n- Bitches love being wanted, so be proud of your sex drive and don't suppress it.\n\n- Speaking your gut will let you know for sure whether a bitch is interested in you or not. You don't have to guess and hamster anymore. \n\n- Raw, unapologetic, unrelenting sexuality will be noticed and craved.",

It was at an upscale cafe I frequent every now and then.

It was very clear I was talking about inviting her over to dick her down. She looked extraordinarily surprised at my forwardness and complied. Two weeks went by (I was extraordinarily busy) and I called her and **told** her I wanted to see her tonight. I gave her my address, we hooked up,  but I decided against plating her because she was psycho and I could tell she had some daddy issues.",

Either way, I was happy at the end of the day because I was either balls deep in a bitch or I knew for certain that a woman was not interested in me. No guessing games, no hamstering, I either got a new notch in my belt or a solid rejection. \n\nSo the next time you're sitting on your ass wondering what to text a bitch or your mind is racing at 9000 miles an hour trying to figure out what to say to the bitch in front of you... stop. Just say what comes to you from your primal masculine energy and stop thinking so damn much, but make sure you say it with some **balls.**\n\n\nTakeaways\n\n\n- Trust your gut more than your brain when gaming sluts. \n\n- HOLD FRAME WHEN SPEAKING YOUR GUT\n\n- Bitches love being wanted, so be proud of your sex drive and don't suppress it.\n\n- Speaking your gut will let you know for sure whether a bitch is interested in you or not. You don't have to guess and hamster anymore. \n\n- Raw, unapologetic, unrelenting sexuality will be noticed and craved.",

            "body": "Trust Your Gut When Talking to a Slut.**Summary: You already know what to say to her but youre too scared to say it. Trust your gut and say the first thing that comes to you. Youll feel fulfilled whether you fuck her or not and you can stop hamstering about whether she wants you or not.**\n\nWeve all had this experience. Youre talking to a bitch and you really want to say some nasty, crude, downright vile shit to her. You want to tell her about how shes gonna choke on your unborn children, how youre gonna ass-fuck her so hard shes gonna be wincing in pain whenever she sits down, how you cant wait to see her in handcuffs begging for mercy...but you dont out of fear. Fear of offending her, fear of offending the masses, fear of something. \n\n**This fear is the result of social conditioning. Since day one youve been born into a liberal-feminist society that has taught you to suppress and run from your primal instinct. This suppression ruined your primal game and turned you into a meek beta-cuck wage slave begging and waiting for pittance and post-wall yeast-infected pussy.**\n\nI could go on about how society as a whole is a direct result of our masculine instinct being suppressed, but youre not here for that; youre here to find out how you can use your masculine instinct to shove your meat dragon into an Asian girls dumpling over and over again until she drips soy sauce.\n\nThe next time youre chatting with a bitch you need to turn your brain off. Stop thinking so damn much and speak from, and with, your gut. Chances are, your brain is still poisoned by the propaganda weve been force-fed since we came out of our mothers vagina. Your brain holds you back when it comes to primal matters, especially sex. Your brain is trying to balance your urges as a man and what our degenerate, decaying society wants of you, so turn that shit off and trust your gut.\n\nHeres the catch; you have to absolutely mean what you say and have the frame to back it up. This is TRP101, but this bears repeating. You cant be some high-pitched nerd saying to an HB9\n\n*y-y-y-yeah g-url Im gonna f-f-f-uck you with my lego death star you...uhhh...dirty slut!*\n\nThis doesnt mean you go around breaking the core tenets of TRP. Dont go around telling your co-worker that she's eating your raw meat tonight. Don't tell your boss that you want to use her paperweight as a butt-plug and fuck her on her desk. Dont shit where you eat and please, for the love of God, dont say this type of shit to the fat blue-haired feminist liberal dykes that frequent The Blue Pill subreddit.  I want you to catch STDs, not court cases.\n\nIm going to give you an example to drive my point home. One where I fail so I can keep the post short and you can learn something from my mistake. Yes, my shit stinks too.\n\nA while ago I was trying to fuck this small little Filipina that couldnt have weighed more than 115 pounds. We met through a former roommate of mine but I got her number and stayed in touch. We were out one day and she commented on how I looked bigger and stronger since wed last met. I said the first thing that came to me without hesitation...\n\n**Yeah, I could probably pick your tiny ass up and throw you around like a little ragdoll. I could have fun with you.**\n\nThe look on her face was psychotic, animalistic, primordial. She smiled an ear to ear smile and her eyes widened. When a woman truly wants you its not like the sexy, nail-biting shit you see in movies; its downright psychotic. I made the mistake of letting my surprise for her reaction show. She sensed my surprise and I dried her pussy up like the California droughts. Whoops. \n\nNotice how the line wasn't even a good one. I could have said something a lot smoother, but I didn't, I said the first thing that came to me and it worked all the same instead of hamstering and looking for \"the right thing to say\" or \"the best line.\" \n\nI took note of this and decided to say the first thing that came to me and to hold frame from then on.

Youll feel fulfilled whether you fuck her or not and you can stop hamstering about whether she wants you or not.**\n\nWeve all had this experience. Youre talking to a bitch and you really want to say some nasty, crude, downright vile shit to her. You want to tell her about how shes gonna choke on your unborn children, how youre gonna ass-fuck her so hard shes gonna be wincing in pain whenever she sits down, how you cant wait to see her in handcuffs begging for mercy...but you dont out of fear. Fear of offending her, fear of offending the masses, fear of something. \n\n**This fear is the result of social conditioning. Since day one youve been born into a liberal-feminist society that has taught you to suppress and run from your primal instinct. This suppression ruined your primal game and turned you into a meek beta-cuck wage slave begging and waiting for pittance and post-wall yeast-infected pussy.**\n\nI could go on about how society as a whole is a direct result of our masculine instinct being suppressed, but youre not here for that; youre here to find out how you can use your masculine instinct to shove your meat dragon into an Asian girls dumpling over and over again until she drips soy sauce.\n\nThe next time youre chatting with a bitch you need to turn your brain off. Stop thinking so damn much and speak from, and with, your gut. Chances are, your brain is still poisoned by the propaganda weve been force-fed since we came out of our mothers vagina. Your brain holds you back when it comes to primal matters, especially sex. Your brain is trying to balance your urges as a man and what our degenerate, decaying society wants of you, so turn that shit off and trust your gut.\n\nHeres the catch; you have to absolutely mean what you say and have the frame to back it up. This is TRP101, but this bears repeating. You cant be some high-pitched nerd saying to an HB9\n\n*y-y-y-yeah g-url Im gonna f-f-f-uck you with my lego death star you...uhhh...dirty slut!*\n\nThis doesnt mean you go around breaking the core tenets of TRP. Dont go around telling your co-worker that she's eating your raw meat tonight. Don't tell your boss that you want to use her paperweight as a butt-plug and fuck her on her desk. Dont shit where you eat and please, for the love of God, dont say this type of shit to the fat blue-haired feminist liberal dykes that frequent The Blue Pill subreddit.  I want you to catch STDs, not court cases.\n\nIm going to give you an example to drive my point home. One where I fail so I can keep the post short and you can learn something from my mistake. Yes, my shit stinks too.\n\nA while ago I was trying to fuck this small little Filipina that couldnt have weighed more than 115 pounds. We met through a former roommate of mine but I got her number and stayed in touch. We were out one day and she commented on how I looked bigger and stronger since wed last met. I said the first thing that came to me without hesitation...\n\n**Yeah, I could probably pick your tiny ass up and throw you around like a little ragdoll. I could have fun with you.**\n\nThe look on her face was psychotic, animalistic, primordial. She smiled an ear to ear smile and her eyes widened. When a woman truly wants you its not like the sexy, nail-biting shit you see in movies; its downright psychotic. I made the mistake of letting my surprise for her reaction show. She sensed my surprise and I dried her pussy up like the California droughts. Whoops. \n\nNotice how the line wasn't even a good one. I could have said something a lot smoother, but I didn't, I said the first thing that came to me and it worked all the same instead of hamstering and looking for \"the right thing to say\" or \"the best line.\" \n\nI took note of this and decided to say the first thing that came to me and to hold frame from then on. This attitude and embracement of my primal sexuality turned my dating life around completely. My success rate skyrocketed, but so did my rejections. Either way, I was happy at the end of the day because I was either balls deep in a bitch or I knew for certain that a woman was not interested in me. No guessing games, no hamstering, I either got a new notch in my belt or a solid rejection. \n\nSo the next time you're sitting on your ass wondering what to text a bitch or your mind is racing at 9000 miles an hour trying to figure out what to say to the bitch in front of you... stop. Just say what comes to you from your primal masculine energy and stop thinking so damn much, but make sure you say it with some **balls.**\n\n\nTakeaways\n\n\n- Trust your gut more than your brain when gaming sluts. \n\n- HOLD FRAME WHEN SPEAKING YOUR GUT\n\n- Bitches love being wanted, so be proud of your sex drive and don't suppress it.\n\n- Speaking your gut will let you know for sure whether a bitch is interested in you or not. You don't have to guess and hamster anymore. \n\n- Raw, unapologetic, unrelenting sexuality will be noticed and craved.",

It was at an upscale cafe I frequent every now and then. Since I emphasize common sense, I didn't walk up to her and say \"holy shit I want you to ride my dick until it looks like a deflated pepperoncini\" but I played it cool conversationally until it was time to bag the number, without any hesitation or planning I said...\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**\"Look, you need a man like me in your life.\"** I gave her my phone. **\"Put your number in my phone and I'll invite you over.\"**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShe's not stupid. It was very clear I was talking about inviting her over to dick her down. She looked extraordinarily surprised at my forwardness and complied.

I gave her my address, we hooked up,  but I decided against plating her because she was psycho and I could tell she had some daddy issues.",

            "body": "Trust Your Gut When Talking to a Slut.**Summary: You already know what to say to her but youre too scared to say it. Trust your gut and say the first thing that comes to you. Youll feel fulfilled whether you fuck her or not and you can stop hamstering about whether she wants you or not.**\n\nWeve all had this experience. Youre talking to a bitch and you really want to say some nasty, crude, downright vile shit to her. You want to tell her about how shes gonna choke on your unborn children, how youre gonna ass-fuck her so hard shes gonna be wincing in pain whenever she sits down, how you cant wait to see her in handcuffs begging for mercy...but you dont out of fear. Fear of offending her, fear of offending the masses, fear of something. \n\n**This fear is the result of social conditioning. Since day one youve been born into a liberal-feminist society that has taught you to suppress and run from your primal instinct. This suppression ruined your primal game and turned you into a meek beta-cuck wage slave begging and waiting for pittance and post-wall yeast-infected pussy.**\n\nI could go on about how society as a whole is a direct result of our masculine instinct being suppressed, but youre not here for that; youre here to find out how you can use your masculine instinct to shove your meat dragon into an Asian girls dumpling over and over again until she drips soy sauce.\n\nThe next time youre chatting with a bitch you need to turn your brain off. Stop thinking so damn much and speak from, and with, your gut. Chances are, your brain is still poisoned by the propaganda weve been force-fed since we came out of our mothers vagina. Your brain holds you back when it comes to primal matters, especially sex. Your brain is trying to balance your urges as a man and what our degenerate, decaying society wants of you, so turn that shit off and trust your gut.\n\nHeres the catch; you have to absolutely mean what you say and have the frame to back it up. This is TRP101, but this bears repeating. You cant be some high-pitched nerd saying to an HB9\n\n*y-y-y-yeah g-url Im gonna f-f-f-uck you with my lego death star you...uhhh...dirty slut!*\n\nThis doesnt mean you go around breaking the core tenets of TRP. Dont go around telling your co-worker that she's eating your raw meat tonight. Don't tell your boss that you want to use her paperweight as a butt-plug and fuck her on her desk. Dont shit where you eat and please, for the love of God, dont say this type of shit to the fat blue-haired feminist liberal dykes that frequent The Blue Pill subreddit.  I want you to catch STDs, not court cases.\n\nIm going to give you an example to drive my point home. One where I fail so I can keep the post short and you can learn something from my mistake. Yes, my shit stinks too.\n\nA while ago I was trying to fuck this small little Filipina that couldnt have weighed more than 115 pounds. We met through a former roommate of mine but I got her number and stayed in touch. We were out one day and she commented on how I looked bigger and stronger since wed last met. I said the first thing that came to me without hesitation...\n\n**Yeah, I could probably pick your tiny ass up and throw you around like a little ragdoll. I could have fun with you.**\n\nThe look on her face was psychotic, animalistic, primordial. She smiled an ear to ear smile and her eyes widened. When a woman truly wants you its not like the sexy, nail-biting shit you see in movies; its downright psychotic. I made the mistake of letting my surprise for her reaction show. She sensed my surprise and I dried her pussy up like the California droughts. Whoops. \n\nNotice how the line wasn't even a good one. I could have said something a lot smoother, but I didn't, I said the first thing that came to me and it worked all the same instead of hamstering and looking for \"the right thing to say\" or \"the best line.\" \n\nI took note of this and decided to say the first thing that came to me and to hold frame from then on. This attitude and embracement of my primal sexuality turned my dating life around completely. My success rate skyrocketed, but so did my rejections. Either way, I was happy at the end of the day because I was either balls deep in a bitch or I knew for certain that a woman was not interested in me. No guessing games, no hamstering, I either got a new notch in my belt or a solid rejection. \n\nSo the next time you're sitting on your ass wondering what to text a bitch or your mind is racing at 9000 miles an hour trying to figure out what to say to the bitch in front of you... stop. Just say what comes to you from your primal masculine energy and stop thinking so damn much, but make sure you say it with some **balls.**\n\n\nTakeaways\n\n\n- Trust your gut more than your brain when gaming sluts. \n\n- HOLD FRAME WHEN SPEAKING YOUR GUT\n\n- Bitches love being wanted, so be proud of your sex drive and don't suppress it.\n\n- Speaking your gut will let you know for sure whether a bitch is interested in you or not. You don't have to guess and hamster anymore. \n\n- Raw, unapologetic, unrelenting sexuality will be noticed and craved.",

Youll feel fulfilled whether you fuck her or not and you can stop hamstering about whether she wants you or not.**\n\nWeve all had this experience. Youre talking to a bitch and you really want to say some nasty, crude, downright vile shit to her. You want to tell her about how shes gonna choke on your unborn children, how youre gonna ass-fuck her so hard shes gonna be wincing in pain whenever she sits down, how you cant wait to see her in handcuffs begging for mercy...but you dont out of fear. Fear of offending her, fear of offending the masses, fear of something. \n\n**This fear is the result of social conditioning. Since day one youve been born into a liberal-feminist society that has taught you to suppress and run from your primal instinct. This suppression ruined your primal game and turned you into a meek beta-cuck wage slave begging and waiting for pittance and post-wall yeast-infected pussy.**\n\nI could go on about how society as a whole is a direct result of our masculine instinct being suppressed, but youre not here for that; youre here to find out how you can use your masculine instinct to shove your meat dragon into an Asian girls dumpling over and over again until she drips soy sauce.\n\nThe next time youre chatting with a bitch you need to turn your brain off. Stop thinking so damn much and speak from, and with, your gut. Chances are, your brain is still poisoned by the propaganda weve been force-fed since we came out of our mothers vagina. Your brain holds you back when it comes to primal matters, especially sex. Your brain is trying to balance your urges as a man and what our degenerate, decaying society wants of you, so turn that shit off and trust your gut.\n\nHeres the catch; you have to absolutely mean what you say and have the frame to back it up. This is TRP101, but this bears repeating. You cant be some high-pitched nerd saying to an HB9\n\n*y-y-y-yeah g-url Im gonna f-f-f-uck you with my lego death star you...uhhh...dirty slut!*\n\nThis doesnt mean you go around breaking the core tenets of TRP. Dont go around telling your co-worker that she's eating your raw meat tonight. Don't tell your boss that you want to use her paperweight as a butt-plug and fuck her on her desk. Dont shit where you eat and please, for the love of God, dont say this type of shit to the fat blue-haired feminist liberal dykes that frequent The Blue Pill subreddit.  I want you to catch STDs, not court cases.\n\nIm going to give you an example to drive my point home. One where I fail so I can keep the post short and you can learn something from my mistake. Yes, my shit stinks too.\n\nA while ago I was trying to fuck this small little Filipina that couldnt have weighed more than 115 pounds. We met through a former roommate of mine but I got her number and stayed in touch. We were out one day and she commented on how I looked bigger and stronger since wed last met. I said the first thing that came to me without hesitation...\n\n**Yeah, I could probably pick your tiny ass up and throw you around like a little ragdoll. I could have fun with you.**\n\nThe look on her face was psychotic, animalistic, primordial. She smiled an ear to ear smile and her eyes widened. When a woman truly wants you its not like the sexy, nail-biting shit you see in movies; its downright psychotic. I made the mistake of letting my surprise for her reaction show. She sensed my surprise and I dried her pussy up like the California droughts. Whoops. \n\nNotice how the line wasn't even a good one. I could have said something a lot smoother, but I didn't, I said the first thing that came to me and it worked all the same instead of hamstering and looking for \"the right thing to say\" or \"the best line.\" \n\nI took note of this and decided to say the first thing that came to me and to hold frame from then on. This attitude and embracement of my primal sexuality turned my dating life around completely. My success rate skyrocketed, but so did my rejections. Either way, I was happy at the end of the day because I was either balls deep in a bitch or I knew for certain that a woman was not interested in me. No guessing games, no hamstering, I either got a new notch in my belt or a solid rejection. \n\nSo the next time you're sitting on your ass wondering what to text a bitch or your mind is racing at 9000 miles an hour trying to figure out what to say to the bitch in front of you... stop. Just say what comes to you from your primal masculine energy and stop thinking so damn much, but make sure you say it with some **balls.**\n\n\nTakeaways\n\n\n- Trust your gut more than your brain when gaming sluts. \n\n- HOLD FRAME WHEN SPEAKING YOUR GUT\n\n- Bitches love being wanted, so be proud of your sex drive and don't suppress it.\n\n- Speaking your gut will let you know for sure whether a bitch is interested in you or not. You don't have to guess and hamster anymore. \n\n- Raw, unapologetic, unrelenting sexuality will be noticed and craved.",

            "body": "Trust Your Gut When Talking to a Slut.**Summary: You already know what to say to her but youre too scared to say it. Trust your gut and say the first thing that comes to you. Youll feel fulfilled whether you fuck her or not and you can stop hamstering about whether she wants you or not.**\n\nWeve all had this experience. Youre talking to a bitch and you really want to say some nasty, crude, downright vile shit to her. You want to tell her about how shes gonna choke on your unborn children, how youre gonna ass-fuck her so hard shes gonna be wincing in pain whenever she sits down, how you cant wait to see her in handcuffs begging for mercy...but you dont out of fear. Fear of offending her, fear of offending the masses, fear of something. \n\n**This fear is the result of social conditioning. Since day one youve been born into a liberal-feminist society that has taught you to suppress and run from your primal instinct. This suppression ruined your primal game and turned you into a meek beta-cuck wage slave begging and waiting for pittance and post-wall yeast-infected pussy.**\n\nI could go on about how society as a whole is a direct result of our masculine instinct being suppressed, but youre not here for that; youre here to find out how you can use your masculine instinct to shove your meat dragon into an Asian girls dumpling over and over again until she drips soy sauce.\n\nThe next time youre chatting with a bitch you need to turn your brain off. Stop thinking so damn much and speak from, and with, your gut. Chances are, your brain is still poisoned by the propaganda weve been force-fed since we came out of our mothers vagina. Your brain holds you back when it comes to primal matters, especially sex. Your brain is trying to balance your urges as a man and what our degenerate, decaying society wants of you, so turn that shit off and trust your gut.\n\nHeres the catch; you have to absolutely mean what you say and have the frame to back it up. This is TRP101, but this bears repeating. You cant be some high-pitched nerd saying to an HB9\n\n*y-y-y-yeah g-url Im gonna f-f-f-uck you with my lego death star you...uhhh...dirty slut!*\n\nThis doesnt mean you go around breaking the core tenets of TRP. Dont go around telling your co-worker that she's eating your raw meat tonight. Don't tell your boss that you want to use her paperweight as a butt-plug and fuck her on her desk. Dont shit where you eat and please, for the love of God, dont say this type of shit to the fat blue-haired feminist liberal dykes that frequent The Blue Pill subreddit.  I want you to catch STDs, not court cases.\n\nIm going to give you an example to drive my point home. One where I fail so I can keep the post short and you can learn something from my mistake. Yes, my shit stinks too.\n\nA while ago I was trying to fuck this small little Filipina that couldnt have weighed more than 115 pounds. We met through a former roommate of mine but I got her number and stayed in touch. We were out one day and she commented on how I looked bigger and stronger since wed last met. I said the first thing that came to me without hesitation...\n\n**Yeah, I could probably pick your tiny ass up and throw you around like a little ragdoll. I could have fun with you.**\n\nThe look on her face was psychotic, animalistic, primordial. She smiled an ear to ear smile and her eyes widened. When a woman truly wants you its not like the sexy, nail-biting shit you see in movies; its downright psychotic. I made the mistake of letting my surprise for her reaction show. She sensed my surprise and I dried her pussy up like the California droughts. Whoops. \n\nNotice how the line wasn't even a good one. I could have said something a lot smoother, but I didn't, I said the first thing that came to me and it worked all the same instead of hamstering and looking for \"the right thing to say\" or \"the best line.\" \n\nI took note of this and decided to say the first thing that came to me and to hold frame from then on. This attitude and embracement of my primal sexuality turned my dating life around completely. My success rate skyrocketed, but so did my rejections. Either way, I was happy at the end of the day because I was either balls deep in a bitch or I knew for certain that a woman was not interested in me. No guessing games, no hamstering, I either got a new notch in my belt or a solid rejection. \n\nSo the next time you're sitting on your ass wondering what to text a bitch or your mind is racing at 9000 miles an hour trying to figure out what to say to the bitch in front of you... stop. Just say what comes to you from your primal masculine energy and stop thinking so damn much, but make sure you say it with some **balls.**\n\n\nTakeaways\n\n\n- Trust your gut more than your brain when gaming sluts. \n\n- HOLD FRAME WHEN SPEAKING YOUR GUT\n\n- Bitches love being wanted, so be proud of your sex drive and don't suppress it.\n\n- Speaking your gut will let you know for sure whether a bitch is interested in you or not. You don't have to guess and hamster anymore. \n\n- Raw, unapologetic, unrelenting sexuality will be noticed and craved.",

Youll feel fulfilled whether you fuck her or not and you can stop hamstering about whether she wants you or not.**\n\nWeve all had this experience. Youre talking to a bitch and you really want to say some nasty, crude, downright vile shit to her. You want to tell her about how shes gonna choke on your unborn children, how youre gonna ass-fuck her so hard shes gonna be wincing in pain whenever she sits down, how you cant wait to see her in handcuffs begging for mercy...but you dont out of fear. Fear of offending her, fear of offending the masses, fear of something. \n\n**This fear is the result of social conditioning. Since day one youve been born into a liberal-feminist society that has taught you to suppress and run from your primal instinct. This suppression ruined your primal game and turned you into a meek beta-cuck wage slave begging and waiting for pittance and post-wall yeast-infected pussy.**\n\nI could go on about how society as a whole is a direct result of our masculine instinct being suppressed, but youre not here for that; youre here to find out how you can use your masculine instinct to shove your meat dragon into an Asian girls dumpling over and over again until she drips soy sauce.\n\nThe next time youre chatting with a bitch you need to turn your brain off. Stop thinking so damn much and speak from, and with, your gut. Chances are, your brain is still poisoned by the propaganda weve been force-fed since we came out of our mothers vagina. Your brain holds you back when it comes to primal matters, especially sex. Your brain is trying to balance your urges as a man and what our degenerate, decaying society wants of you, so turn that shit off and trust your gut.\n\nHeres the catch; you have to absolutely mean what you say and have the frame to back it up. This is TRP101, but this bears repeating. You cant be some high-pitched nerd saying to an HB9\n\n*y-y-y-yeah g-url Im gonna f-f-f-uck you with my lego death star you...uhhh...dirty slut!*\n\nThis doesnt mean you go around breaking the core tenets of TRP. Dont go around telling your co-worker that she's eating your raw meat tonight. Don't tell your boss that you want to use her paperweight as a butt-plug and fuck her on her desk. Dont shit where you eat and please, for the love of God, dont say this type of shit to the fat blue-haired feminist liberal dykes that frequent The Blue Pill subreddit.  I want you to catch STDs, not court cases.\n\nIm going to give you an example to drive my point home. One where I fail so I can keep the post short and you can learn something from my mistake. Yes, my shit stinks too.\n\nA while ago I was trying to fuck this small little Filipina that couldnt have weighed more than 115 pounds. We met through a former roommate of mine but I got her number and stayed in touch. We were out one day and she commented on how I looked bigger and stronger since wed last met. I said the first thing that came to me without hesitation...\n\n**Yeah, I could probably pick your tiny ass up and throw you around like a little ragdoll. I could have fun with you.**\n\nThe look on her face was psychotic, animalistic, primordial. She smiled an ear to ear smile and her eyes widened. When a woman truly wants you its not like the sexy, nail-biting shit you see in movies; its downright psychotic. I made the mistake of letting my surprise for her reaction show. She sensed my surprise and I dried her pussy up like the California droughts. Whoops. \n\nNotice how the line wasn't even a good one. I could have said something a lot smoother, but I didn't, I said the first thing that came to me and it worked all the same instead of hamstering and looking for \"the right thing to say\" or \"the best line.\" \n\nI took note of this and decided to say the first thing that came to me and to hold frame from then on. This attitude and embracement of my primal sexuality turned my dating life around completely. My success rate skyrocketed, but so did my rejections. Either way, I was happy at the end of the day because I was either balls deep in a bitch or I knew for certain that a woman was not interested in me. No guessing games, no hamstering, I either got a new notch in my belt or a solid rejection. \n\nSo the next time you're sitting on your ass wondering what to text a bitch or your mind is racing at 9000 miles an hour trying to figure out what to say to the bitch in front of you... stop. Just say what comes to you from your primal masculine energy and stop thinking so damn much, but make sure you say it with some **balls.**\n\n\nTakeaways\n\n\n- Trust your gut more than your brain when gaming sluts. \n\n- HOLD FRAME WHEN SPEAKING YOUR GUT\n\n- Bitches love being wanted, so be proud of your sex drive and don't suppress it.\n\n- Speaking your gut will let you know for sure whether a bitch is interested in you or not. You don't have to guess and hamster anymore. \n\n- Raw, unapologetic, unrelenting sexuality will be noticed and craved.",

It was at an upscale cafe I frequent every now and then.

            "body": "Red Pill Rage makes you look petty.**Introduction**\n\nI recently had a young man send me a text saying how he is mad at the world, how women are a waste of time, F this F that. He lost his cool. As someone who is older than him and as someone he looks up to, I feel like I am personally responsible for not handling this. So I sat him down for a talk, to explain what he is going through. Red Pill Rage.\n\n**Body**\n\nThis is a phase that many men go through after realizing how this world operates. We were once blue pilled simps who were shown the light (or found it/were driven to it). We are now in recovery mode to become who we were biologically born to be. This is a life long process, its slow, but if you are consistent, it will be steady up and up. It's the school of life. You will study, pass, and fail. Its normal.\n\nSomeone going through red pill rage will exhibit symptoms including but not limited to:\n\n* Anger and disdain for women\n* Anger and disdain for the people who raised him\n* Depression and lack of motivation to proceed in the world\n* Confusion as to what to do next.\n\nThe sidebar covers pretty much all the fundamentals that we must go out and practice through execution, but it is not a play by play. It is not a step by step instruction manual on what to do, and this is what frustrates people going through rage even more. And the younger and less based the person is, the worse and chaotic his rage will be. Let me explain why.\n\nThe blue pilled betas can actually teach us something. Their life's goal is to succeed in this world. Have a \"stable\" career, have \"retirement\" savings, have a \"normal\" family, raise \"normal\" kids, etc. They want that blue pilled life dream, even if they have to work their ass off for it. They are WILLING (even if brainwashed) into giving up their lives to build this \"stable\" world around them. Sure there are always exceptions to this rule, but at least the more traditional men, will be chasing a stable career in medicine or engineering or something. This makes them at least well based in their own life. Even if they go through a divorce and realize how blue pilled they are, red pill rage will last a shorter amount of time for them, because they already have a financial and educational foundation. They have a resume, they just have to start their social/sexual life over, which, thanks to the sidebar, is as simple as going out into the real world and fucking up repeatedly until you get the hang of it (not really but you get the gist).\n\nA young man in his late teens or early college years who finds the red pill, and realizes why his young sexual life is absolute garbage, will have severe rage. This is because he has no existing foundation. He hasn't had a marriage/relationship that is long enough to give him some experience. He doesn't have the finances to be able to just move to a new city and start over. He doesn't have a \"successful\" resume. He goes into full panic mode, and eventually, just gives up. He knows he needs to get his shit together, but on top of his obligations to get his financial and practical life together, he is now bombarded with information on how to fix his still not fully developed sexual life.\n\nAgain, there are plenty of exceptions to the rules. I have seen young men who found the red pill and immediately saw the mountain they must climb and proceeded to hatch multiple plans on how to do so. Others...fell into depression cursing the world they live in and becoming more reliant on spoon fed step by step instructions on how to proceed. This dependence on a play by play must be broken.\n\nSo here I will leave some recommendations as to what to do if you find yourself in this situation. This is not a step by step instruction booklet. These are tips that will explain what you are feeling, why, and where to go.\n\n1. You are mad at women for being the way they are. Okay, and? Screw them. Focus on yourself and your individual happiness and satisfaction (in moderation) as well as making sure you have a solid foundation financially and educationally.\n2. \"Everything we do is just to get laid, what is the point?!\" This is where you need to change your mindset. Getting laid is a PERK of having a solid foundation as a MAN. Be a man first, slay pussy later. You need to understand that you do not revolve around women, they revolve around you. You must become a magnet, not be attracted to one. A magnet has scientific properties that make it attract all sorts of metals. IRL this is: Money, fame, good looks, reputation, success, status, masculine alpha behavior/mentality, an IDGAF mentality for sure. Magnets do not fucking care what you are, if you're within range, you will be attracted.\n3. You feel like you know more than the men around you so now you are acting petty and posting on your instagram story about how \"women suck and man up and etc\". Stop. Just stop. You are just like everyone else, we are just like you. We are all in the same boat, you are not special, and just because you know something someone else doesn't, doesn't mean you are better. Also, stop putting red pill stuff you read online on your instabooks, you will alienate anyone who sees it. Just get off social media period, stop texting women and being their little bitch, go to #1 on this list, go make your base. No not a pillow fort. A base, somewhere you live, somewhere you can go to when shit hits the fan and start over. \n\n**Conclusion**\n\nRemember at least one thing from all of this: This is not an over night change. This will take years. Just like the gym wont turn you into the rock over night, reading trp content and practicing it wont make you an alpha over night. I know I am far from where I want to be, but I want to try, and I will try. So go cool off from the rage, accept the world as it is, and learn to use it to your advantage.",

Usually on Friday night, since I don't go out, I have the best time with myself! I throw my own fashion show, where I try on clothes I don't usually wear  or I experiment with my clothes to create different styles, I do my make up, I dance by myself and I sometimes do karaoke. I also wear my high heels which I rarely wear outside! It's not like I am able to forget how undesirable and lonely I am, but at least I am able to have fun by myself!",

She was brown skinned with severe acne problems. Her dry hair is always at chin length and never grew. \n\nAll of us knew each other because we lived in the same area and played together.

The femcel suddenly disappeared. They didn't waste a second to wait for her.\n\n\"Bro, let's go!\" his basketball friend told him. \n\nSo the him and his friend left her there and went home without telling her. \n\nI asked him. \"Bro, why!?\"\n\nHe said. \"Who the fuck am I to wait for her!? She's not even pretty!\"\n\nWell, that was mean. \n\nFast forward, the basketball player asked her out, for God knows why. She agreed. He never brought her anywhere in public. Never held her hand. Never showed her affection. \n\nYou wanna know why?\n\nMy cousin told me that. \"He dated her because he wanna \\*have sex\\*.\"\n\nOut of every place he could've done, he broke up with her in the CROWDED market after HE TOOK HER VIRGINITY. She ended up breaking down into tears in public in front of at least 100 people.

Women over 30 are past it. Women over 35 are useless parasites.\n5. Be from a wealthy family. Right-wing politicians don't actually care about working-class whites.\n6. Be beautiful. Anything under high-tier Becky is pointless.\n7. Be married. Any unmarried woman over 25 is clearly defective or a tradthot.\n8. Be a conservative 'Christian'. Love your neighbour, as long as said neighbour is wealthy, healthy, conservative and white.\n9. Talk about men's issues constantly. Forget about women who are experiencing poverty, domestic violence, sexual abuse or mental health issues. Men need more attention, since the feminazi's are out to turn their sons gay and make their wives run away with black men.\n10.

She's an attractive skinny white blond woman who spends her internet time trying to get people to shit on shooting survivors. I guess \"hot\" means looking like idiot mean girl Tomi Lahren?\n\nAll of these people style themselves based on high school mean girls and Ann Coulter.\n\n  They're all minions of disgusting right wing mouth breathers who secretly wish we lived in \"Handmaid's Tale\" Gilead, rape was legal, and it would probably be legal to murder ugly women or women and little girls who protested rape with impunity.\n\nShe **does** deserve it. No offense OP - but the woman you're posting is right on target, if what she's saying is true.  Fuck Kaitlin Bennett. I enjoy when misogynistic women reap what they sow. You think they're allies? They're not. They're not worth spilling tears for either. And I'm saying this as someone that finds the left as creepy, looksist, and secretly often as misogynistic as the right, so long the selected target is white (maybe Asian), cisgender - shit, even a lot of their attacks on men frequently strike me as fucked up and underwritten by ulterior motives totally divorced from any real, sustainable concept of justice, logic, or interpersonal accountability. Caitlin Jenner - who spent her pre-transition life as a right-wing jock with no interest in problems for women or sexual minorities and apparently has the same politics now, theoretically at her own detriment (but not literally of course - she's rich) - being lauded as a heroine is proof of that, frankly.\n\nI'm just sort of at a loss as to how Kaitlin Bennett isn't \"hot\" but I don't give a shit if misogynistic women reap what they sow. Fuck right, they deserve it. They're agents of the men who want to put their favorite hookers in cabinet positions (Berlusconi), make rape legal, illegalize any medication or health procedure women need to participate in society as equals/control their own reproduction, and create a right wing theocracy. \n\nNo sympathy.\n\nAlso - whoever this LivPosting is, she's not actually a hot chick or any \"hotter\" than Bennett; she strikes me as an average looking woman calling out a blond bimbo wannabe for supporting an ideology that leaves \"not hot\" chicks out in the cold, so...I dunno, what is the point of this post again? \n\nThis woman isn't justifying looksism, she's pointing out the consequences of hypocrisy and being felled when you charge for misogyny and misogynistic ideology while female. Do you not see that? Are you offended because of your politics (in which case, I guess I should apologize for speaking so frankly) and the apparent anti-woman mindset of this Liv Posting? \n\nAre you really caping for hateful anti-feminists like Kaitlin Bennett, who are even less sympathetic to femcels and ugly women than even shitty corporate \"liberal\" feminists who are as focused on virtue signalling for a paycheck as anything else (like our wonderful friends at Mel Magazine, who have such contempt for the women here they'd lift their posts without asking) and have no empathy for real women if they have a self-serving goal in mind? \n\nThe whole point of these posts is that Kaitlin Bennett supports a misogynistic society where looksism and sexism used against women is embraced. She's a (horrible, hateful, stupid, famewhore) woman without a country.\n\nI'm sorry if you're conservative and that's why you're irked here.\n\n\nRight and left - be it vocal, performative antifeminism voiced by babes of Fox primetime, Tomi Lahren, Meghan McCain, and Bennett; or highly visible corporatized \"feminist\" values presented by shitty faux-\"woke\" startups that are revealed to treat their employees like garbage/shitty \"content\" spewing blogs like Mel, at al are mostly predicated on two things, two gods they worship in kind - self-serving engagement numbers, and money. So they support quashing labor laws and fair wages and fair medical leave and HRs that actually treat sexual harassment seriously and, in Bennett's case, try to jumpstart a career by inciting people to wish murder on high schoolers that watched their friends die, wearing AKs as accessories. On top of whatever right wing woman-hating horseshit she's promoting while hustling for a speaking engagement on the neocon airwaves.\n\nThose antifeminists are the ultimate pickmes and only support feminism (for themselves, primarily, and perhaps women exactly like them) to justify...anti-feminism. To justify pushing the overturning of Roe v Wade. To justify \"my choice is a feminist choice because I have a vagina! (There's no such thing as marital rape! Let's murder gay people and burn witches again! Rah rah rah! Let me show you my tits!)\"-style feminism, from their seats of influence, their soap boxes and promotional events. \n\nThey're all united with one idea in mind - so long as I get mine (get my abortion, my featured piece, my seed funding, can roast other women alive for deserving to be harassed/raped, can use a shitty hashtag phonily presenting any incident where a woman is victimized, polarizing men and woman in the aftermath or something like a high profile revelation of a sex crime) - fuck everyone else. Fuck facts. I want the spotlight. \n\nA pox on all of them. I wish the two camps would cannibalize each other.",

I make people physically uncomfortable. \n\nMy class had a debate on zoom today, and I struggled with public speaking (as usual). One girl had her microphone on & she laughed at me when I stuttered for a moment & forgot my argument. Everyone in my class thinks I'm massively retarded, and they will speak over me or completely ignore me. \n\nDuring the debate this one guy kept picking on me and being rude/ condescending. I noticed a stark difference in the way he spoke to me v.s the prettiest girls in class. It is pure suifuel, & makes me feel like complete shit\n\nOur professor asked us how the debate went at the end of class. This one girl from my group (who really dislikes me) openly stated that \"certain people\" in our group are \"incredibly frustrating\" and she \"couldn't stand\" listening to them. Those were her words, almost verbatim. Everyone just laughed...but it was clear she was talking about me. There are only THREE ppl in our group. I don't know why she had to be so nasty and passive aggressive. I am nothing but nice to her. I guess ugly people are garbage though & worthy of no respect \n\n I waited until the zoom session ended to speak with my teacher about my struggles with class participation/ public speaking. I immediately choked up and stated to cry before I could say 2 words. My teacher just sat there with this awkward smile on her face and asked if I wanted to \"come back in 2 minutes.\"\n\nWe then had this INCREDIBLY awkward conversation. It felt like I was holding her hostage lol. Even my own teacher thinks I'm a creepy weirdo. I explained my autism & struggles with social anxiety, and she suddenly started talking about how many students find the course material\" unfamiliar\" and \"intimidating.\" She couldn't understand why I was upset..... You should have seen how uncomfortable she was lol.\n\nThat was one of the most awkward moments of my life. She looked like she thought I was fake crying.

Still worth it, IMO. \n\nUnfortunately, as you've probably realised, it's pretty much impossible to find genuine friends when you're trying.

Best thing to do is try and improve your alone time, and dose yourself with bits of social contact (family, internet, etc.) for basic survival. \n\nIf you're seriously desperate for some one-off social contact, talking about random shit in the Omegle spy question mode kept me above water for a long time. You just have to go through a lot of bots. \n\n(I do recommend video games though, it's a really good way to get \"back\" into socialising, since you only really need to talk about the game.)\n\nGenuinely sorry you've been having a bad couple of days.

From what I have observed, it usually means quite the opposite. People's low self esteem can manifest in different ways. Some may show this by not wanting to take or show pictures of themselves. Others may post pictures for the sole purpose of getting people to \"like\" it and compliment them. No one with high self esteem would need that much attention from people. Both cases indicate someone with low self esteem in my opinion. I knew a handful of girls in highschool who had a lot of instagram followers and what not yet they had horrible self esteem for whatever reason. Not getting enough likes on a picture would cause them to delete it.

It doesn't matter that they may perceive themselves as ugly, we do not share the same experiences and they have no right to infiltrate one of the few spaces genuinely ugly people have. Ugly women in real life have no voice. Normies are committed to ensuring that we don't have a voice online either by stealing spaces meant for us, then having the AUDACITY to expect us to have sympathy for them because :( they're insecure :(.

From what I have observed, it usually means quite the opposite. People's low self esteem can manifest in different ways. Some may show this by not wanting to take or show pictures of themselves. Others may post pictures for the sole purpose of getting people to \"like\" it and compliment them. No one with high self esteem would need that much attention from people. Both cases indicate someone with low self esteem in my opinion. I knew a handful of girls in highschool who had a lot of instagram followers and what not yet they had horrible self esteem for whatever reason. Not getting enough likes on a picture would cause them to delete it.

It doesn't matter that they may perceive themselves as ugly, we do not share the same experiences and they have no right to infiltrate one of the few spaces genuinely ugly people have. Ugly women in real life have no voice. Normies are committed to ensuring that we don't have a voice online either by stealing spaces meant for us, then having the AUDACITY to expect us to have sympathy for them because :( they're insecure :(.

Like I said, daydreaming is something even normies/NT's will do, it doesn't necessarily have to be bad.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIt becomes \"maladaptive\" when it's used as your preferred coping mechanism for loneliness or boredom (just two examples). Daydreaming might feel nice at the moment you engage in it, but especially the maladaptive kind will take up significant chunks of free time that you could be using to solve the underlying problems that are causing you to daydream in the first place.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIndicators of daydreaming being maladaptive are for example:\n\n- making facial expressions/talking during daydreaming sessions\n\n- feeling distressed when something is preventing you from daydreaming\n\n- preferring daydreaming over real life activities/socializing\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThese are just a few things I remember.\n\nI don't have any advice on how to stop it, though.

            "body": "Musings on a MSM's journey towards masculinity.Me: 26 years old, teacher, living in a big but not huge city.\n\nI am writing this post to share my experience as a 'gay' man, particularly my experience in the last couple years of beginning to embrace and explore my masculinity.\n\nI was an effeminate boy. I've pondered my upbringing and the origins of my homosexuality/my former gay-ness (I use homosexuality to refer to instincts, gayness to refer to identity and behavior). My father was not entirely absent, but he was an impulsive, self-centered, and often-absent alcoholic that in large degree parented by compensating with money, presents, and promises. My mother doted upon me and I was her little boy. Both of my parents loved me in their own way, but I had very little positive masculine guidance and role modeling in my youth.\n\nI had many friends, both male and female, in elementary school, though by sixth grade or so my associations with other males began decreasing, and after entering middle school essentially completely stopped. Once I entered puberty, all my friends were females or other gay/queer males. This state continued until about a year and a half ago.\n\nBeneath this was a troubled relationship with men and masculinity. I was sexually and emotionally drawn to masculinity, yet also afraid of most men (particularly masculine ones, and above all straight, masculine men). I experienced constant cognitive dissonance about my masculinity, femininity, and sexuality. I had lots of shame and self-loathing. I thought of myself as better than men I observed doing 'guy stuff' and had disdain for dudes being dudes, men being men.\n\nI began having sex at seventeen years old, primarily with older men I met on dating apps. I spent several years frequently having mostly mediocre to poor sex with older men (25-40) I today would have absolutely no interest in. I engaged in risky behaviors, put myself in dangerous situations repeatedly, and shied away from, botched, or rationalized away the majority of attempts with guys my own age I was genuinely interested in. Almost everyone I dated or fucked I met online. I watched lots of porn, sometimes quite extreme stuff, and spent years and years masturbating and ejaculating alone, daily.\n\nOf course, life is diverse and we traverse and are traversed by many different things. Despite and throughout a lot cognitive dissonance and confusion, in many ways I followed my passions and instincts, said fuck you to society's and everyone's expectations, and did what I wanted.\n\nA turning point came a couple years after graduating from university. I was living in Australia and had spent eight months living a lot of anger, jealousy, social incompetence, low self-esteem, etc. A few months before leaving I withdrew and reevaluated. For the first time in my life, I made fitness a priority. I also began two experiments that changed my life and brought me towards manhood: I began restoring my foreskin, and I stopped jerking off and cumming for the first time.\n\nI came back to the United States and spent a while confronting demons. In the past two years living here again, I've gone through professional, personal, romantic/sexual, and life experiences. I've fucked up and I've succeeded. A year and a half ago I began working as part of an all-male team, and six months ago began looking at the threads for Red Pill and Semen Retention. This was the first time in my adult life that I have socialized in all-male environments (outside the gay world). I have learned:\n\n\\- There's no such thing as 'sheeple'/'woke', beta/alpha, basic/not-basic. There is passive, non-aware submission to the flow of the world, and active consciousness. We all embody both, just to different degrees. Everyone is moving at some pace or another either towards or away from more active consciousness.\n\n\\- I am a man. I am sexually attracted to other men, but I am in a male body, not a female. My personality contains feminine elements. I spent many years pushing down, ignoring, and rejecting my masculinity.\n\n\\- I wasted vast amounts of energy for years on bad sex, shooting my load onto my belly or a T-shirt, and fantasizing about the people I want to be. I am filled with creative, masculine, and powerful energy that I want to use to conceive of ideas, create things, improve myself, and realize goals with.\n\n\\- Semen retention is a powerful way to cultivate and build energy to do things in life. Abstaining from sex, masturbation, and ejaculating has brought me emotional and physical growth, and the longer I go, the more I feel unexcited sexually and romantically by people not interested in self-improvement, goals, and big things, and the smaller grow my neediness for validation through emotional/romantic/sexual attention etc. The longer I go, the more I actively ask myself: Why? Why do you want to date/fuck/log onto a dating app/go to a bar etc? What are you looking for?, and the more I respond and act in a way that is in line with my principles.\n\n\\- Fitness is a beautiful masculine pastime and is indispensable for all guys to explore manhood.\n\n\\- I was traumatized by circumcision and tugging on the skin of my dick to grow a new foreskin has been a powerful way to claim autonomy, independence, and manhood.\n\n\\- I no longer identify as gay. Neither do I identify as bisexual or queer. I feel sexually attracted to men in a more visceral, physical way than I am to women, but it is something deeper than the physical that truly draws me, and it is present in both men and women.\n\n\\- It is not that I am not attracted to women, it is that 1) I am bored by overly-feminine women (and men) with unbalanced gender energy ie helpless woman with clown makeup, cloying mannerisms, and little to no initiative 2) my effeminacy, self-loathing, and socialization as a 'gay man' in my past led me to think of myself as incapable/unworthy of being masculine enough to be the man for a woman, to be her captain, to be the one in charge/stronger/more framed etc.\n\n\\- Gay culture is filled with hyper-feminine, passive men out of touch with their masculinity. The gay world is filled with men that chase heterosexual traditions and norms to have kids, live in the suburbs, etc. There are also many masculine, well-rounded gay/bi/queer men that combine femininity and masculinity in their personalities.\n\n\\- Gay relationships and sex ALWAYS include a masculine/feminine dynamic - submissive and dominant, bottoms and tops, male and female roles, listeners and talkers, etc.\n\n\\- Successful and interesting women are not only excitingly, tantalizingly, and beautifully feminine, they also integrate and cultivate masculinity within themselves and use it when it necessary to make money, realize their goals, raise their children, and engage in great relationships. The best women do this so well that men don't even notice.\n\n\\- The future belongs not to 'alpha' men or the most womanly of women, it belongs to independent minds that combine both genders into something greater, while playing masterfully the game their gender and body challenges them to play.\n\n\\- On a biological level men and women engage in relationships to procreate. The rest is cultural and societal. If you're not fucking and dating to produce kids, what are you doing? If it's not about offspring, the best relationships are about exploring personality, learning, and combining forces to create things and achieve goals. It's fun to be the solid masculinity femininity leans on, and to be the pliant, social femininity for masculinity to explore itself with; I've done both. In the long run, though, if two minds want to build a life (or an interesting time) together, both have to grow out of such a gendered relationship and just be two individuals cooperating, to some extent within the gender of their body, but to a greater extent as something beyond a penis and a vagina.\n\n\\- As a 'gay' man, there is no reason for me to chase heteronormative gender roles. There is no need for me to find a wife, have two kids, buy a house in the suburbs, and fuck men on the side every now and again. There is no need for me to perform the manly man for a submissive gay man (or vice versa), buy a house together and pretend to be man, wife, and kids et al., nor is there a need for us to buy an apartment together and spend our life trying to convince ourselves that we 'love' one another and that the romantic myths everyone else is chasing have come true for us.\n\n\\- Masculinity isn't necessarily about fucking bitches/lots of guys, making lots of money, and being muscular, though for many it is, and will be. Masculinity is about being the fullest version of yourself as possible.",

But now to some extent I think I get it. However, most times my non-neediness comes across as disinterest or arrogance.\n\nFor ex: A girl expects me to be in touch with her constantly. We can't be meeting all the time. She expects that we are in touch with each other constantly either through call or text. So, I'd say I'm busy or I'd say normally I don't text so much but rather I'd like to meet in person instead. Somehow, she ignores this and keeps texting me. Now if I do respond to her everytime she texts me, I'd be texting all day long and eventually I'll come across as low value. On the other hand if I don't reply or take a long time to reply, it'll come across as disinterest or arrogance and she may auto-reject or go find someone who can cater to her needs. If I like the girl, I'll be losing her either way.

You appear low value because you're too available. \n\nNothing else more important is taking up your time? No job? No gym? No hobby? No friends? That subcommunicates that she's more important than anything else going on in your life. Not what she's looking for. \n\nA boundary you can set is that you won't placate women who demand your attention. She can learn to deal with you being unavailable or she can find someone else to annoy.\n\nYou'll find that actually this boundary might upset her initially.

I have all the horrible weaknesses in the world to make dating almost impossible for me. OCD, autism, social anxiety and misophonia. Ive tried PUA and dating sites to disastrous results. The former I didnt know any better about and I regret even trying it.\n\nAnd with this era of Coronavirus, not going outside has got me to this point. I am an autistic neckbeard creep.

Honestly, I was pressured by friends to lose it. However, I held my ground and just told them if I lose it Ill lose it. What Im saying is dont put losing your virginity on a pedestal, when I first had sex it was awkward asf. When I first lost it, I was like was that it? So right now Im glad youre seeking help. What the others have said is take walk or start lifting. \n\nIm so glad I started lifting not only it help your health it also boosted your confidence. However, since all the gyms are closed right now Ill suggest just taking walks then start transitioning into running. Also, like another redditor had said to start worrying about your looks as well. Girls actually see that, if you cared about how you dress/groom yourself. It shows that how you actually present yourself as a person. I highly suggest going to therapy to get your mental health back on track as well.  At the end of the day, is the fact youre trying to better yourself. Since the gyms are closed, I hope you join one once this all blows over. I know you may feel intimidated at first, but honestly people dont care about what you look like or do. Since they are there to workout and move on with their day. Because at the end of the day youre there to better yourself. If they say something about you they can go fuck themselves. I met a lot of friends from the gym. \n\nAlso, one last thing is during this time find a hobby and start branching and find people with similar interests. Then build a connection with them and you never know that you might find that someone and it blossom into something more. I suggest trying to find three hobbies that helps you be creative, money, and being healthy. I as would like to suggest a book to read as well. Its called The subtle of art of not giving a fuck by mark Manson. Truly a really good book on developing a better mindset. You got this I believe in you. This whole subreddit got your back.  We believe in you brother!",

The key stereotype of neckbeards is poor hygiene, if you want to break out of it then get that hygiene under control. Bad hygiene is something that people will unanimously judge you poorly for and for good reason, take that away and youre already leaps and bounds better off.\n\nStep 2, start dieting and exercising. Quarantine is one of the best times to do this. There are tons of how to guides for heavier people who may have a hard time with exercising, itll show you where to start and build yourself up. Remember, its a lifestyle change not just a temporary thing. Its good for your health though, so it for health first and looks second.\n\nFinding a job and working on social anxiety will be hard right now. For your anxiety that might require therapy, Im not a professional but it sound like you may have an actual anxiety disorder. Read the book Overcoming Shyness and Social Anxiety by Gillian Butler, its a book thats given to social anxiety sufferers by doctors in the UK. Itll help you understand your thought patterns better and be a good how to guide on facing your fears.",

Whenever you feel like not doing what you should, try this: acknowledge to yourself this emotion and then simply *do it anyway*.\n\nThe best time to start is twenty years ago, the second best time is yesterday. To address your specific examples:\n\n> I only brush my teeth and shower once a week cause I have this delusional sense of I dont need to go outside\n\nPursue proper hygiene for your own benefit. It's much better to exist in a physical husk that is clean and smells nice. Also, you don't get another body and teeth aren't going to grow back. Even from a financial perspective you are saving money with good habits. An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.\n\n> Im on Disability Welfare\n\nIt's a tool.

Try that. Reflect again. Repeat. The only real mistake is not learning from your mistakes.\n\n> Ive spent hundreds on camgirl chats, escorts, custom pics and videos. \n\nBro. Literally throwing money in the trash is better than spending it on egirls. There will always be more women for you out there, there will not be more yourself for you.\n\nSpend the money on your own self-interests instead. Basic exercise equipment, healthy whole foods, clothes that fit, fundamental hygiene accessories, etc.\n\n> I am 130kg\n\nThis is one of the most salient areas of improvement right now. You don't need to leave the house to start living healthier. Drink enough water, get enough sleep, eat enough protein + vitamins/minerals, and AT LEAST one hour of exercise a day. Day 1: sufficiently taxing cardiovasular activity (lay down and bicycle pedal if you have to) and Day 2: strength training. Repeat. Eat less calories than you burn to lose weight. You can gain muscle and lose fat at the same time.\n\n> I just do not want to be like this anymore.

You can get past that.\n\n> Finally, I wonder if this is even possible? Turning 26, never got remotely in a close relationship in my entire life and being an autist I really worry to see that I can get more mature than identically a 12yo\n\nYou could spend another quarter of a century being unproductive and STILL have more than enough time to turn your life around. You are still at the beginning of creating who you are, the finish line isn't even remotely close to being visible.\n\nThe most important thing is to structure this progress. Don't overwhelm yourself with impossible goals and then get dejected when they don't work out. All you need to do is NOT do nothing, even if it's just one thing per day.\n\nWhile you have a lot of downtime now, read the sidebars: /r/bodyweightfitness /r/malefashionadvice /r/skincareaddiction /r/seduction",

I was neither angry nor impatient nor insecure nor needy. I was confident, calm, smooth, rational, fun but not forcibely, everything was so genuine about me, and I felt totally in synch with myself.  \n\nWhat I noticed about those moments, aside from the inner peace I had. Is that people just followed me. If I was with a girl then seducing her was not necessary, Hell I didn't have to talk or say anything, I could sit there with a girl totally silent and somehow I could feel that she's enjoying my company. Same with guys. And when I said let's go there or do that and I lead, they just followed, no questions asked, no \"Why!! we can't, it's better to do that and that\" It was a great feeling. But I am unable to stay in that state for very long.   \n\n\nThis made me wonder, if I improve myself to the point where I'm in that state most of them time, what would I need girls for apart from sex?

You just want to maintain your frame as a calm, confident guy and escalate physically from being platonic.  More importantly, the time to act on things is when they feel right.  The time for a funny comment about her kissing you, is in response to when she brings it up.  The easiest time to escalate physically is if you're already dancing with her and physically close, etc.\n\nFrom the little I know about your situation, it's tough to say where you stand.  But bottom line is that women like a witty, confident guy who doesnt seek their approval and presents as a challenge.  Live your best life, study/work, lift weights, meditate, avoid porn, etc.  Internalize the traits while improving your life with the above work ethic and you will be attractive to most women.\n\nWith THIS girl specifically, if she's attracted you already, then you have to escalate your relationship from platonic to physical.  If she is into you , but doesnt see you as a guy who has the balls to act on his desires... you will be permanently friendzoned.  Hopefully that's not where you are.  \n\nRegardless, just live your life, have fun, tease her when you can, and don't try too hard.  Create sexual tension in situations where you can (look it up if you dont know what it means).  Break the touch barrier with non-threatening touch;  elbow, small of back, back of hand, etc.  Keep strong eye contact if you dont already, and a hint of a smile is also a good bet.  But most importantly, ACT when you have an opportunity;  to tease her, to escalate physically, etc.  Use the opportunities when she compliments you, to escalate and banter.  E.g. If she says she was into you the other day or compliments your dancing, you can say something like \"I dont blame you..  I actually had to turn it down a notch, I didn't want you to lose control\".  In other words, tease her when she compliments herself and agree with her in a cocky way when she compliments you.  Use your own words and style, they matter way less than your actions, body language and ultimately your balls to act.  Dont pass up good opportunities to act and escalate physically, sometimes they dont come again...",

She lived next door and we quickly became friends  as we had a lot in common. At the time I was very bad with girls and had no experience. I quickly developed a crush on her but had no idea to make a move. She would often flirt with me when drunk but I was oblivious and shy at the time. Fast forward I grew some balls and started talking to girls and getting with women. This led to me and her eventually hooking up. However she quickly started displaying weird behavior. She would flirt with me all night and then leave with another guy, was constantly hot and cold I thought I was buggin but her friends agreed that this was a habit of hers. I became upset with her and my neediness caused her to end things but I found out that she had lied to me about something else and ended our friendship. She begged me for forgiveness and so I forgave her.\n\nThe year after we start hooking up again but one night while we're walking home she ditches me and sleeps with my best friend who had a gf. He knew I liked and even bragged about lying to her and how bad she wanted him to me and other friends. Im beyond upset and tormented. Firstly that she would sleep with a guy like that, I usually couldn't care who she sleeps with, not that she even needs my permission but it just makes it ten times worse to think that she would sleep with a guy like that. (fast forward he did something similar to another friend months later but they were actually about to date the girl.) . Obviously this is more of a me problem why does it bother me so much that she'd sleep with a guy like this. I mean I'd understand like if the guy was actually charming but he wasn't good looking, was narcissistic and a compulsive liar. When I asked her about it she said she was really drunk and him as well, which checks out. But idk if she was drunk enough that she didn't know what she was doing.\n\nAn important part of this story is we never had sex we would always get close but she always claimed she'd feel bad bc her best friend had a huge crush on me and told her not to. Which was true. I think this made it all the more worse as he got something so easily that I had been trying so hard for. But she also had a string of toxic behavior that made me question if this was the real reasoning or if she was just manipulating me, for validation.(I could never tell although she did seem sincere when she said she did want to sleep with me). \n\nLogically I know this girl and friend aren't for me and I should move on from both but their both stuck in my head, its been many months now and time isn't helping. I constantly think about the two of them together. And for some strange reason I still want her, no girl has come close. I've had sex with a few more girls since but nothing is filling the gap. I want her out of my head\n\nsorry for any grammatical errors and if it seemed like I was jumping around I left out a lot of events to try and get to the point faster.",

            "body": "Fwbs - Unsure if she's pulling back...confused on what to do?I'm unsure if she's consciously pulling back, she's lost interest, or she's just comfortable....but something has changed. \n\nI've been seeing my female colleague Fwbs for the last 6/7 months. She initiated the whole thing and we called each other our 'distractions'. \n\nSex started out as once a week, which gradually increased overtime. In Feb, she told me we may have to stop as she's starting to feel attached. I think this was to gage my reaction and interest level.  Up until then, I held my emotions close to my chest and always let her bring up the flirtiness and 'emotions' first - she would often message saying she would like a cuddle or whatever and then apologise for \"needines\" saying as \"there's no place for it\".  I always reciprocated to the same level and energy. \n\nThen in March, I started to compliment her more and tell her how much she turned me on etc. At the start she told me she was very needy and insecure - and believe it or not, but these compliments and reassurances did wonders for our 'relationship' - we were having sex nearly everyday. We ended up staying a night in a hotel through work - the day after, she was telling me how much she liked it and that it made her feel like she wanted more. She then wrote me a long message about how attracted she was physically/sexually and started it off by saying \"some things are best left unsaid\" - I asked her but she refused to tell me. At this point, it was her doing most of the chasing - I was just sitting back and letting things happen. \n\nThen lockdown happened. We have a bit of freedom so can see each other occasionally. For the first few weeks, she would come over a couple times a week, however, I would always have to ask her (I've always done it, I think she feels too vulnerable in making plans for sex) as she would never invite herself round. She was still being flirty by message, saying she wished she had more time etc. to come round. \n\nThen, 3 weeks ago, I asked her round and she said she couldnt but \"would honestly love to see me. Maybe tomorrow?\". I said \"yes, providing you can get here by xx as my roommate will be in\". She replied \"I will see. You can always meet me for one of your walks on the weekend\". I said \"my roommate normally comes with me so we'll have to see\". She then had a slight outburst and said \"you told me you normally walk alone, good to know I won't have to go out my way\". I replied \"he does on the weekend but not in the week\". Anyway, she said that was \"nice we do that\" and then messaging continued in a normal chit chatty vibe.  I will admit, I did tell her I walked alone everynight a few days before and I only said my roommate comes with me on the weekend to lash out in response to her saying no - she's always so flakey and I felt like she asked me about 'going for a walk' as I didn't reciprocate her saying \"she would love to see me\".  \n\nFrom that point however, she has taken a lot of emotion and flirtiness out of her messages. We've met 3 times since, once for sex and I can still feel her physical attraction is strong. But her messages have been quite dry. I will also say that she does continue to message me first everyday (always, always messages me first) until we say goodnight, but it's mainly chit chat and about work stuff. She seems to deflect any flirtiness and doesn't initiate any emotions anymore. \n\nI like her a lot and want more but it's difficult as we work in a very small team, and neither of us wants to be rejected. \n\nI just find it odd that up until the whole walking conversation, she told me a few days prior that she was missing me, and that seeing me once a week wasn't nearly enough. Then a few days after the convo, we met up and she said to me \"little every so often is nice though, at least it's something\". I mean, seriously? \n\nAnother interesting point, is that nearly a week prior to the walking convo, we had sex and she messaged afterwards. It seemed like she was 'teeing' me up to be emotional towards her first but I didn't. Nothing obvious but my gut told me by her messages that what she was doing. And when I didn't, it's like she tried to play it cool after. \n\nI want to ask her if she's okay but it's been a while and I wanted to see if she would come around and be more open but she hasn't. I also don't want to ask her as it will make her feel vulnerable and she will likely deny it anyway. I'm also cautious that perhaps I've overpursued her and she's losing interest and backing off slowly. \n\nIs it best to just play it cool, give her space and let her come to me more, or just tell her \"I think I upset you?\". I wonder if she's slowing things down to keep her emotions in check - perhaps she realised we were getting carried away? I just don't want to blow it by coming across as needy and seeking validation when there's nothing concrete to present back to her...",

Even online sometimes, we'll be flirting and she'll be suggestive back, then out of nowhere I'm blocked or unmatched. That all makes me feel like I suck at reading people. I can neither trust my gut instinct to read them, nor can I trust them to be giving genuine signals.\n\nBut that's also a sligtly separate issue than my mind drawing a complete blank when it comes to being flirty in-person.",

However, with the only three areas that Ive had success with women out of the picture, Ive got no clue where to meet women to end this dry spell.\n\nIm not depressed about it or anything, I actually really value my time alone.

Im in the field of law still finishing up my studying though. I like the comments so far. But Ill throw in a more specific example of when this has happened. Ill mention the career field and they suddenly ask what car I drive, type of house I want etc. Another thing is like when Im confident or vague they start saying like yah I can tell why youre in the field. What annoys me is that they are extra inclined to be in my life and suddenly everything I do is cause of my career lol. Its not a bad I guess. But its just off putting cause its just my career. Im really not the type to care about what field anyone is in cause Im not very judgmental. There is a plus side I guess.

The last year was spent applying what Ive learned. \n\nNo shocker here, but the results have been great. Success with women has been awesome, Ive built my own business, improved my physique and also replenished my finances.\n\nLately though Ive been feeling some anxiety and low level depression seep back in, so Ive restarted my therapy appointments.\n\nWith the TRP principles internalized, its hard for me to not speak about certain subjects and it comes out through a TRP perspective.\n\nI can already tell that my (female) therapist thinks Im sexist or misogynistc. Pretty much any of the females in my life come to a similar conclusion and think Im an asshole, or evil.\n\nIm not an autist with what Ive learned. I dont openly talk about TRP concepts or shove it in anyones face. But Ive internalized enough of it now to the point of its just who I am for the most part.\n\nI dont try to manipulate anyone, make them feel like shit, or harm anyone. I try to be an all around good person, but yet Im still hearing these comments and seeing disgusting faces at my beliefs.\n\nReally just looking for some wisdom to consider and chew on from you guys. Just to ground myself and reset.\n\nEdit - Just remembered that my therapist is also a lawyer that specializes in divorces. Things are starting to make a bit more sense now.",

Sits inside all day and beats off and plays video games. \n\nI come downstairs because of all the yelling, and see him banging his head against the wall just screaming telling my parents to leave him the fuck alone, my dad trying to grab him to stop him from banging his head, while my mom tells my dad to just let him run his course, and that if he truly wants to kill himself we wouldnt be able to stop him \n\nHe storms out, steals my bike, so I try to go follow him, but cant catch up. I get my parents to call the cops, so they can find him before he tries anything. They find him over the edge of a bridge, and get him down. Hes in the hospital right now. \n\nI was never close with him, or any of my family. What do I do moving forward? Hes so stubborn, so if he doesnt end up killing himself, idk how Ill get him to turn his life around, which I think is the root of his problems. \n\nHes very convicted, and I think because of his depression and low serotonin, he reacts to any attempt to help him change with extreme hostility. \n\nAny advice on how to move forward? How to help him? Or at least keep my family from falling apart?",

I get girls more easily but men seem to be threatened by me and theyre passive aggresive/purposely leaving me out of events etc. Also new men I meet who are physically more beta/dont workout are passive aggressive toward me even when I am nice to them and dont compete with them. Sometimes this happens with other jacked men too. \n\nJust before lockdown started, I went to a bar with friends and was hooking up with a friend of a friends gf. We were all there together and I started getting attention from some other girls. Another woman (few years older) tried to hit it off with me in front of everyone and I played it cool and she left for a bit. I didnt initiate anything. Then I went to the toilet and she followed me. My friend clocked it and came to grab me.. he told her to piss off and was angry with me. He said I was supposed to be dating his gfs friend and I wasnt strong enough with the other woman but I could tell he was just jealous that I got attention and he didnt. He was punching me in the ribs calling me stupid but to me it was a translation for Im angry that you got so much attention and I cant get that\n\nNow Im a nice guy. Even when I know other men cant compete with me I dont rub it in their face because honor and respect. And getting girls isnt the goal of my life. I actually want real bros. It just pisses me off that they cant see that and by being nice I get treated like shit its weird. I didnt do anything wrong with this woman. I got attention that I didnt look for.\n\nSo my question is how do you be Chad AND likeable at the same time? My friends joke that I look like a fuckboy which means they subconsciously think I look like I fuck a lot of women but they only put a negative spin on it because they cant do the same. They have left me out of the pack so many times as if Im some dishonourable guy who chooses hoes over bros but I never do.\n\nMy female friend whos a PHD biologist (a very logical female whos honest about hypergamy) told me that Im a threat to 90% of men. Also at the bar my friends gf told me when she was drunk that Im really handsome and every girl at the bar probably wants to fuck me. My friend didnt hear and neither did the girl I was dating. (Her friend)\n\nSo what am I doing wrong and how do I become more likeable? It seems that men dont respect me for whatever reason. Are betas more liked by everyone because theyre softer and more agreeable? I mean Im never an asshole to people but Im always strong in my convictions and never lie. I thought this would command respect from other people but it doesnt seem to. Hmm or maybe thats not it. Its just I have this one friend who everyone loves but hes not alpha at all. Hes adopted the new age mantra and is all about positive vibes etc. Im not like that as Im a realist, but Im not an asshole either. So I dont get it. \n\nWhat do you think?",

            "body": "Had my first date in 3 months. Accidentally blew my load in a minute - Can this be salvaged?Well boys - Have I got a story for y'all.  I welcome any words of advice, wisdom, or how to play this moving forward.\n\nLike many of you, I've been in quarantine for the past 2 months. Finally, in the last 2 weeks, I decided to say fuck it and download Tinder again. Before that, I was doing some solid self-introspection, reading, home workouts, learning to trade options, no drinking, no weed, lots of meditation. All was well. I was feeling great!\n\nDuring this time, I also stayed away from Porn and only jacked it once a week to no porn.\n\nFast forward to yesterday and I had my first outside date with a bird in that span of time. Super fucking cute, short Asian girl with amazing tits. I took her to my usual spot, which is this outdoor walking street with cafes and whatnot. We grab some cold drinks and start working around the area. All was going phenomenal with exceptional banter, kino, easy-flowing conversation, etc.\n\nI said let's get outta here and we headed back to my place to 'watch a documentary' as that's what it said she liked to do in her profile.\n\nWe hung out on the couch, more kino, kissing, slowing escalating, she's getting wet and ready to go. It's getting to the point where she has to go home, but I take is LMR and just keep escalating.\n\nEventually, her dress on the floor and those gorgeous fucking tits are flopping around in my face.\n\nWe're both naked and eventually, I caveman carry her to my bed. We're still working up to sex, which is fine, so I flip her around and we start 69'ing.\n\nWell here's where it all went to hell! After 2 months of quarantine, and not even having the chance to touch a bird, I fucking let myself accidentally get way over-excited, and as she's giving me the best head this side of 6 months - using her mouth in ways only god knows  - before you know it I'm shooting a giant premature fucking load in her mouth. I lasted maybe a minute. Not my proudest minute at that. I had no problem when she was jacking me off vigorously, but as soon as she went down on me, while I'm eating her out, I fucking lost it.\n\nI haven't cum this fast in years.\n\nTo make matters worse, she jumps up and runs to the bathroom to spit out my spunk, just leaving me sitting there on the bed.  I mean, maybe she was surprised at my load, maybe I fucking hit the back of her throat. I don't fucking know.\n\nShe comes back out of the bathroom, and I try to play it off as if I'm just gonna finish her. I go down on her for a little bit longer and she says she needs to finally get home - it's 11:30 pm and she has to wake up at 7 am. I say cool and here's where she proceeds to give me the ego dick punch of death. \"Oh - you came so fast\" in what can only be described as a disappointing tone.\n\nI wasn't quick enough on my feet to come up with a good line, but I also didn't fucking show emotion either. I just played it off to quarantine and not having any action in a while. Just like it was no big deal, and just hoping it was a shit-test. So many other things I could have said, trust me I know. But the damage was done and my ego lay in tiny fucking shards all over the floor.\n\nSo boys - what do you think? Any chance of salvaging this. I feel like there's no fucking way I'm gonna contact her now. Gonna just have to wait for her.  And if she does contact, I'll just never bring it up again like it never even happened. Again - every other part of the date was great. I actually enjoyed conversing with her. That is the first time in a while.\n\nThing is, I've got 3 more dates lined up with 3 different birds this week alone, but I'll be dammed if my ego won't let me forget this performance. Of course, I want the revenge fuck now to show her what I can really do in bed.\n\nWhat do you think lads?\n\n**Edit #1**: She literally just reached out asking for some innocuous link to another documentary I had mentioned. If she really wanted to ghost, she wouldn't have contacted at all, I think.\n\n**Edit #2:** Lads, you're all legends! Cheers for the solid advice from all of you. I truly appreciate it. Some hard lessons to learn, but that's all part of the process.\n\nAs a consensus: DGAF Attitude, Amused Mastery, Ego is the Enemy, Better Psychological Stimulation, and Eat that Pussy Better are the lessons learned. Just been a little outta practice. Quarantine does weird shit to the social skills. But it will all come back. On to the next one!",

He always says stuff about how he wishes I would try and beat my ass so he could show me how much of a little boy he is, talks about how he loves beating up short guys, how they are all pathetic little boys.\n\nThis dude gets off on apparently hurting short guys. Hes 510 and probably 130 lbs. hes not a stud, hes a loser financially, he doesnt have anything going for him. I dont think its ever worth fighting, especially as I am a rising leader in my local business community I will not risk any of that for some loser.\n\nSo i kind of just need advice.

She said, she felt bad because she didnt completely negate his sexual behavior and briefly entertained the idea at the time. She has brought him up to me before and she considered him to be one of the few people at work that she could be friendly with, since the place is loaded with overweight, snarky Karens. I asked her if she did anything with him and she said no, which I do believe right now. \n\nShes been working at this place for about 3 months and she told me about the guy from the beginning. I sensed it would come to this at some point. I laughed it off and told her oh that must be your work husband. She also told me hes kinda fat and that Im much better looking. If hes working as a nurse, I also know Im more financially stable than him. The guy does know about me and yet he continues to pursue my girl. \n\nThis man has an LTR and a child which he lives with. He told her that his girlfriend would be cool with it if they had a thing on the side and that his gf is also bisexual. I dont know how she responded to him because I didnt take it too seriously when she brought it up. When she told me about it, I said I appreciate your honesty and Im not gonna hold it against you. Is this guy texting you? She said; no he doesnt have my number. Then I said, Ive seen the type of guys that hit on you and Im not worried about any of them lol. She laughed and got slightly offended. My LTR is definitely the type to crave male attention from what I can see and Im sure she was flattered by the fact that this guy pushed up on her. \n\nMy question is, am I going to have to demote this girl to a plate eventually? Is this a major red flag? Whats the likelihood she ends up fucking this dude? Do I have to go down to her job and fight this dude? \n\nIve been way too available to this woman for the past 4-5 months. Taking every phone call on her break and spending all my free time with her. Should I start ignoring her calls and distancing myself from her more? I just setup some dating apps and Im beginning to cultivate new leads on girls. Am I overreacting to this whole thing?

That particular story is about a reckless bet between a farmer and the devil: the challenge was to prove which of them could better dig furrows in the ground. Unfortunate farmers wife decided to help her husband and showed her lady parts to the devil, complaining that her husband had tried out his claws on her body and had scratched her between the legs. The devil apparently was not at all familiar with the womens anatomy, as he thought that it was some kind of terrible wound; he got scared that his opponent is so mighty, gave up the challenge and run away.",

So what he was asking was if women fart periodically every 5-15 minutes during ovulation so it would be acceptable if the ovulating woman was to have sex.\n\nAccording to him all he knows about ovulation is women are more likely to get pregnant and they are gassy.\n\nEdit: I should elaborate, I agree with him about women possibly having stomach issues when ovulating, thats what I was discussing with my friends when he interrupted.

This isn't something that really concerns me. The way I see it, if we get married, my money becomes *our* money so it doesn't matter in the end as long as my partner can support himself and shares my financial values. However, what I discovered over and over again in the dating pool was that men themselves seemed to have more of an issue with it than I did. \n\nWhat was most hurtful was when I would begin seriously dating someone only to discover they felt insecure and resentful about it further down the road. They didn't like their girlfriend picking up the tab for things. They felt stupid waiting for me at home while I worked long hours. They didn't want to play \"second fiddle\" to their girlfriend as they saw it and have my career be the one dictating our living situation. These things hurt their pride and made them feel emasculated.\n\nI don't believe every man is like this. But isn't this how TRP would have men act? The brand of destructive masculinity TRP touts would have you believe that all these things ARE inherently emasculating and negative. Would they allow their girlfriend or wife to have a career that comes up against theirs or be the primary breadwinner in their household? My sense is no.\n\nSo what is the end result here? If that's the case, I'm effectively forced into giving up my lucrative career at my partner's behest, or only dating men who equally or more successful than I am who won't feel threatened by me. So wouldn't RP ideology force me into \"hypergamy\" on its own?",

I didnt think Id get it. Ive posted on reddit so much for therapeutic reasons and met with a lot of hostility. I decided to just grow up and realise I was being an IDIOT. Ive had female friends, Ive got with girls in the past, I dont deserve this idiocy and neither do women or those around me. I am gonna change, but not to get laid or anything. Actually, I suspected that I wouldnt ever get laid and I literally didnt care - because I wanna love women not hate them, have a healthy mindset to benefit my happiness and those around me. However it turns out Im actually fairly cute - so fixing my mindset and being happy, I might actually attract a girl, if I am lucky. But if it dont: its okay. Im not entitled to anything and if I was never to meet another woman again in my life, I still dont want this hate and sadness in my heart. Thanks for all the replies and the many who private messaged me, which all of them were women bar one - which is just a great show of how kinda women can be and how diverse and different they are. \n\nIve got friends, I was working out and continue to do so, I have hobbies but I wanna develop more, try out any sport I can once I get to college, go to college to better myself, all the while working on myself.

You really dont -have- to watch anything, but I do think it could be beneficial for you in deconstructing your past beliefs.

                    "body": "You are never going to get the reassurance of the subjective experience of others. I'm married and I've been with my partner for a decade. Is he with me because I make incredible lasagna? Because he loves me in a cosmic, unchangeable way? Because he wants me in a lustful way? Because I was convenient? Well, yes. All of that, at times, and probably more reasons. I honestly have no idea most of the time. A decade-long thing doesn't last on lust alone. So it's a bit of everything, I'm guessing, but I really have no way of measuring his subjective experience of me. So, for my peace of mind, I don't really try to do that. I am not, inherently, interested in how his brain engages with his choice to be married to me, it's just not that important. I can't know it, it wouldn't change anything material about my experiences with him, and it really is none of my business anyway. \n\nOther people's experience of me isn't my business. \n\nAll I can control, all I have power over, is how I am treated and what kinds of experiences I want in my life. That's it. I can solicit behaviors, I can reject behaviors, but ultimately that's all I can sway. My husband treats me like he loves me in a cosmic way. He treats me like he wants me sexually. He treats me like I make great lasagna. And sometimes he treats me like a fixture in his life he doesn't have to question and can just rely on automatically, which I appreciate since I do it too. His behavior matches with my internal set of expectations for how someone who loves me would behave, and he says he loves me, so that's good enough. I don't really need to interrogate if what I think about as love and what he thinks of as love are identical experiences or motivated for the right reasons. The experience of being loved by him *is* acceptable, so that's good enough. \n\nAll anyone can do is tell you and show you their truth. If they tell you they want you and they show you they want you, that's as much as you'll ever get. If they tell you they respect you and they treat you respectfully, that's all you'll ever get. All you can do is set expectations about what level of commitment, love, and respect is required for you to be intimate with someone and go from there. You get to set your expectations for how you want to be treated and people can meet them or not. You further decide to put up with it or not. For now, in human history, you're never going to get to look behind the curtain and see someone's real motivations, to experience their reasoning and desire, to get capital 'T' Truth on how they feel about you. \n\nSelf-esteem is a real kick in the teeth on this one. It is the force that informs you when you're being tolerated as opposed to cherished. It's what tells you that your subjective experience of your beauty is the only thing that matters, that evidence of someone's lust must be a lie. If you hate yourself, you'll never believe that the words and behaviors you're experiencing are truthful because, how could they be? And, really, no one will ever be able to tell you differently because that's the entire toolbox at their disposal. But that's not their failing to impart their truth, that's your inability to read it and accept it. As a result, a lot of people only accept people with nasty, cruel behaviors and words because that feels more real, somehow, or at least offers up something believable. Swing a dead cat and you'll probably hit someone willing to treat you badly and confirm your bad self-assessment. So, yeah, in the most obnoxious way possible, a lot of this comes down to fixing your own internal metrics for the expectations you set, the behaviors you'll tolerate, the evidence you'll find convincing. Which just...sucks. Because that's hard, painful work that takes a long time to internalize. But doing it makes everything so, so much nicer.",

So Ive decided to take another approach, to change your perspective and encourage you to actually enjoy the remaining days of your self-quarantine.\n\nFirst and to ease your mind, allow me to point out that once you look beyond the fear and anxiety, you will understand that there is an expiration date. You dont know when, but you know there is one. That alone will give you the strength to endure. This is the power of impermanence.\n\nI know as youre going through it, it might not seem that way as theres a natural human inclination to think that whatever is going on is the way its always going to be. Obviously, thats not the case. This will be over again. It might be a few weeks, it might be a few months but it is going to end.\n\nAllow me also to point out that you currently have one incredible asset in your possession that most people usually dont have in their lives which is time.  \nTime is maybe the one asset in life you cant replace and we spend it usually running around going paycheck to paycheck hustling and bustling We have a period now where we dont have a choice but to have some time. Were stuck at home and that is actually an incredible opportunity.\n\nI am going to list a lot of action steps that I consider very important so you can choose the ones youre interested in and focus on them.\n\nThe idea is to get you doing those things and do as much relaxation or entertainment as you want. That will be your reward! Whats important is that you enjoy your reward.\n\nLets get right to it...\n\n&#x200B;\n\n#### Be kind\n\nTake 15 minutes from your day to call your grandparents or anyone you know who is especially at risk of complications from the virus.  \nCheck in on elderly neighbors you know (while keeping your distance). If they need supplies and feel unsafe going to the store, offer to go for them; or just give them a call to see how they are doing. And if you order something to your house, like pizza, generously tip the delivery guy.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n#### Stay healthy (Physically)\n\nThis is not a health pandemic. So please please please stay healthy!  \nDont get fat, keep eating well : get your fruits and vegetables. Take Vitamin D by getting some sunlight.  \nThis is a great moment to establish healthy routines by changing our diet and incorporating better nutrients into it.\n\nIts also a great time to catch up on your sleep and let your body figure out your own personal circadian rhythm.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n#### Stay healthy (Mentally)\n\nYou can safely go outside while avoiding close contact with other people and touching surfaces that may be infected, and sometimes, this is the best thing you can do for your mental health. Soaking up sunshine and breathing fresh air will help rejuvenate you and make you feel better.  \nYou can also practice your walking past a stranger awkward smile you know the one\n\nWeve all tried time and time again to get into a meditation routine, but there always seems to be something (like life, yknow!) that gets in the way. Well, now that many of us are staying home during the day we have the perfect chance to follow through on making this a new habit.\n\nAnother habit you can practice is self-care. It is one of the best things you can do to keep your mind healthy and happy. And self-care is imperative to stress management.  \nAnd yes, for the guys reading this, its okay to practice some form of self-care. Its not exclusive to girls.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n#### Stay fit\n\nNo gym? No problem! We are creatures of habit and as such we get used to our daily routines and rituals. This is a great time to try and challenge yourself in other ways.  \nTry a new fitness app. Do some push-ups, do some sit-ups, do squats in your room whatever you have to do. The important thing is that you keep moving, get your blood pumping and sweat as much as you can. This will benefit your mind and body equally.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n#### Read and study\n\nOne of the most amazing resources we have as human beings is the fact that we stand on the shoulders of giants. We dont have to relearn everything from scratch we dont have to figure everything out, almost everything you want to learn has been written down somewhere, its been put into a course by somebody or into a very good self-improvement blog (wink wink) so take advantage of this time to read a good book or study a subject that youve been wanting to study.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n#### Stay connected\n\nRemember the phone? A long time ago it was used for a lot more than just texting and Instagram. Pick it up and call a parent, friend, or co worker. FaceTime with your friends. Improve your relationship with your family.  \nIts important to keep working on your social skills, dont get rusty in that area and dont go into this depressive isolated place. This is actually in some ways an opportunity to bridge new social connections or to deepen the social connections you already have.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n#### Start your passion project\n\nNot everyone is lucky enough to call their career or job their passion, but everyone has a passion. Maybe you want to start a home bakery or maybe you want to start your entrepreneurial adventure, theres really no better time than when youre sitting around doing nothing to get that in place and get that started.\n\nYou dont have to complete whatever project you start in the amount of time we are on lockdown, but you can definitely get the ball rolling and really create some momentum that would allow you to finish it soon.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n#### Learn a new skill\n\nThe business world is rapidly changing and new skills are needed constantly, but it can be nearly impossible to learn something new while youre just trying to keep your head above water at work. So take that online coding class, practice your video editing skills, or start learning a foreign language now. Imagine the surprise on your co-workers faces when you return from this hiatus speaking German!\n\nThere are lots of ways to teach yourself, with blogs, apps and online courses at your fingertips. If you learn a useful skill while away from the office, you will return to what may be a difficult job market with a leg up on your competition.",

If it starts to feel or smell gross I can just change into another one, and I can do that up to 13 times in a day (unlikely but still) before I lose the benefit of buying cheaper. Plus I can just put them in the wash without thinking.\n\nMy opinion is that high end tees really only have two purposes:\n\n1. Ultra premium high thread count fabric means you're looking really fly at an event.\n2. You're camping/hiking and so the properties of wool become a huge benefit.\n\nNotice how neither of those purposes include everyday use. Tees are thin, and also you wear them every day. That's a recipe for disaster that's going to end up with holes, stains, rips, etc. Which are you more comfortable trashing because of this? A $120 shirt, or a $9 shirt?",

                    "body": "Former textiles guy here. Generally what this says about wool/cotton/poly is true but many caveats.\n\n**Poly doesnt absorb**- true the material itself doesnt absorb, but youll notice most sportswear  worm when youre sweaty is poly. Why?  Because you can extrude the thread in high-surface area threads break up surface tension or hollow threads that use capillary action to which away.  (Imagine the play dough machine squeezing out a  macaroni shape vs a star shape noodle, the star shape will wick better.  Poly is also quicker to dry because it doesnt hold onto the water due to absorption.  \n\nPoly is also more durable.  This is because the fibers are smoother and dont create the self-abrasive friction that wears down yarns as much as other fibers.  Wool & cotton are both rough under a microscope.\n\n**Cotton comparison vs wool.** - there are several types of cotton on the market.  The 2 main differences in the material are 1) fineness and 2) long staple vs short staple.  The construction also contributes to feel and utility greatly, but  t-shirts are usually a type of knit (vs weave)\n\nThe video covers Fineness a bit.  In addition to contributing to hand feel it also improves color-fastness. This is because the ratio of surface area to fiber thickness is high and the dye can more fully saturate.\n\nStaple length:  the cotton staple is the fiber and different varieties have different lengths.  These fibers are twisted together to create a yarn (thread) and then it is knitted into your shirt. Long staple fibers can be tangled better because they can twist around each other more times. This means 1) you can get finer yarns. And 2) you have less hairs poking out of the yarn as there are less fiber ends to create the yarn.  Both contribute to the smoothness of the yarn.  Smoother yarn has better hand feel. This height number of tangles also means the yarn strength is better AND the smoother yarn means more durable than cheaper yarns (as with poly) Types of long staple yarn are Pima, Supima, sea island and Egyptian (high caution on Egyptian as there has been a lot of fraud there). In my opinion supima is the best, its the same species as pima but better growing methods and its guaranteed USA grown, so better oversight. \n\nLow staple cotton is generally lower quality crop with less certifications, so it is cheaper.\n\n**recommendations**\n\nIf youre going to get a wool/cotton blend shit, my recommendation is merino/supima blend\n\nIf you want the best 100% cotton shirt: supima cotton\n\nFor a cheaper option that is more durable and has wicking and anti wrinkle properties, look for cotton/poly blends.  Ratios of 60/40 or 70/30.  Again my preference would be for supima/poly blend but in general the poly will make the cotton feel softer.",

Despite what she says about being stressed with homeschooling the kids or adjusting to telework at home, lack of attraction is why you arent getting laid. Its also why she is acting like a sexless cunt and bitchy first mate right now. I already see it happening to friends and coworkers.\n\nLook, if you aint Gaming, you aint Fucking. MRP is red pill on hard mode because you have to find a way to game the same woman every day. Once you find it, you must internalize it as your own so it flows out naturally.\n\nEspecially now, she is seeing you all the time. All of your weaknesses are magnified. For you fat beta fucks, its like trying to light a fire with damp wood. She simply isnt attracted to you. You arent getting laid for a reason and she is probably shaming you for even trying.\n\nIf you aint Gaming, you aint fucking. Your wife isnt yours. Its just your mother fucking turn with her. Dont be mad that Chad fucked her back in college in the foam party on spring break, he earned it. He gamed her. She thought he was hot. She didnt need an emotional connection.\n\nMysterys Cat String Theory still applies. If you just give the string to the cat it will be bored and stop trying. What the typical wife does when she marries beta billy. He turns into a blue pill faggot and she loses attraction.. If you put the string too far away from the cat it wont try to chase it. You must keep the string just out of reach of the cat and tease it. Keep the attraction going, drive bys, DHVs, teasing like shes your bratty little sister, kino, Fuck with her mind..always.\n\nNow more than ever, keep her mind busy or she fill it in with a bunch of nonsense. 100% chance it will be directly proportional to money too. Your wallet will pay for it. More than ever, women are in competition with each other to display their resources. I know dudes not getting laid but getting suckered/ shamed into expensive kitchen upgrades, building pools, etc. all because theyre failing to guide their wives during this time. Women stay plugged in and spend all fucking day long on instafuck, fuckBook, tik-fucking-tok these days comparing and contrasting their resources with other women, if you arent providing the tingles or feelz, shell start bitching about the next expensive home renovation or vacation that she REALLY needs.\n\nKeep your emotions in check. Dont show weakness, save it for your bros or keep to yourself. She doesnt give a fuck about you. She only cares how you make HER feelz. Keep your DHVs going. Also keep the illusion of work going. Never break Kayfab. Pro wrestlers never give the act away no matter how silly it is... Always stay in character. Even if youre considered non essential at work, she doesnt need to know that. You just got promoted congratulations. Let her know the important work youre doing. Tell her about the task force you were just assigned to. Wear a fucking headset and act busy as fuck during the day at your laptop. Print out a schedule and mark it the fuck up and tape it on the wall. Get dressed for your skype presentation. If you have free time, start a side business online. Women are attracted to high status and value. Must keep your high value going. If you appear to be doing nothing all fucking day long shell dry up. Let her see all your work wives emailing and texting you. Keep giving the gift of Dread. Let her see how much they miss working with you in the office.\n\nWhat have you done for me lately? They dont give a fuck that you took them on that expensive vacation last summer, what did you do for them right now? Always add right now after everything they say to give it context. Woman are always after more resources, trinkets, and prizes.\n\nDont get lured into arguments if she says you never do this or that. You never take me on such and such vacation - youre right, I reserve those for my girlfriends smile and grin. Keep AA at all times. Shes flooded with emotions right now, bet your ass youll be shit tested. Dont take the bait. Lead her. I ordered from XYZ restaurant, Im leaving to pick it up have the kids ready when I get back. Im grilling steaks tonight so go ice down the beer. Dont ask what she wants.\n\nTake her on a virtual trip. Everyday around lunchtime, I take her out on the back patio. No kids allowed. Tell those little assholes to stay inside. MCT bought a bottle of red and bottle of white, told her to get her ass out on the back patio. We watched some videos on Napa valley.. travel channel, etc have fun, joke around. NLP terms its called future pacing.\n\nTalk about the future and what you plan on doing. Keeps her childlike and gets her into her hindbrain and out of her mommy mode forebrain. She feelz stressed from the kids, work, and all the Karens out there. Take her on a virtual trip and learn about these new places. Youre doing this for you, shes welcomed to join you. Let her feelz your strength, confidence, and DGAS attitude. Watch when she post pics of the 2 wine glasses on fuckBook and how all the other women swoon over what you created for her. Dont compete with anyone, let them compete with you.\n\nKeep Prizing yourself. Be the Prize- by Prizing yourself. This is a great old school Swing Cat PUA move. Guy is a legend. Make it seem she is trying to win you over. Tease her, neg her. Did you just come over here to flirt with me? Keep that up babe, youre earning points with me. First time I told my wife she was earning points with me was at a party with her friends. They couldnt believe I said that. IOIs and all over me for the rest of the night. Also the opposite of that is good too-, babe, youre losing points with me- if she drops something. Cheeky smirk, ass slap, walk away.\n\nA healthy marriage is one where she submits to you - you have to keep a higher value then her. Doesnt work the other way around despite what mainstream advice says. Best marriage is one where your balls remain empty. Must have male and female polarity for it to work. You cant be a walking doormat.\n\nKeep your T levels up. Dont eat shit all day. Workout, pushups, chin-ups, squats, walk around the block,. Punch yourself in the balls if you have to. Stop fapping like a bitch. Low T level, means being weak, means not leading, means bitching wife, means No sex, means expensive kitchens in your future.\n\nDont be a lazy piece of shit. After your work is done for the day, for fucks sake clean up. Do yard work, pressure wash, clean all the shit up youve been neglecting the past year. Dont lose your day gaming skills -Im not talking about fortnite either you faggots. Revisit the basics and why it works.\n\nReframe everything. This is a chance to double your workouts. Clean the fucking house. Spend more time enjoying your kids. More time honing your skills. More time to fuck.\n\nCool, calm, and collective. Dont be a keyboard jockey these days. Dont become obsessed with politics and the news. Check it once a day to stay informed. But stop being a bitch about it. That shit is purposely designed to make you feelz powerless. Conquer and divide tactics. Theyre pitting sides against each other.\n\nA grown man doesnt get angry over politics. It makes you look extremely unattractive. Its a weak example for your son too. Its a victim mindset. Shows that you arent the center of origin.\n\nWhen is the last time you got a great blow job? Strong powerful man get great blow jobs. Say what you want about Bill Clinton, this dude was a champ at BJs. Go watch YouTube videos of him playing Mayor Game  how he just owned a room when he walked in.. dude could drop panties like no other. .\n\nHow you act today will remain with you for the rest of your life. Did you get shit done? Act like a little bitch? Failed to lead? Fail to help your kids?Did you work on yourself? Did you set goals and start action towards them?Become the King. The king doesnt complain or whine to the queen. When you act like a King, you start getting treated like a King. Women are preprogrammed to reward their prize with sex.\n\nI use to blame everything and everyone out there. I blamed the weather, politics, the company, company policy, mission statement, the economy, the news, the president, the party in power. Its a fucking lie. You were lied to. Its all a set up. Its a joke.\n\nYou are the only one to blame. The world is abundant. You are the key to your better future.\n\nIf you aint gaming, you aint fucking.\n\nBe safe.\n\nMTC",

Women are preprogrammed to reward their prize with sex.\n\nI use to blame everything and everyone out there. I blamed the weather, politics, the company, company policy, mission statement, the economy, the news, the president, the party in power. Its a fucking lie. You were lied to. Its all a set up.

Despite what she says about being stressed with homeschooling the kids or adjusting to telework at home, lack of attraction is why you arent getting laid. Its also why she is acting like a sexless cunt and bitchy first mate right now. I already see it happening to friends and coworkers.\n\nLook, if you aint Gaming, you aint Fucking. MRP is red pill on hard mode because you have to find a way to game the same woman every day. Once you find it, you must internalize it as your own so it flows out naturally.\n\nEspecially now, she is seeing you all the time. All of your weaknesses are magnified. For you fat beta fucks, its like trying to light a fire with damp wood. She simply isnt attracted to you. You arent getting laid for a reason and she is probably shaming you for even trying.\n\nIf you aint Gaming, you aint fucking. Your wife isnt yours. Its just your mother fucking turn with her. Dont be mad that Chad fucked her back in college in the foam party on spring break, he earned it. He gamed her. She thought he was hot. She didnt need an emotional connection.\n\nMysterys Cat String Theory still applies. If you just give the string to the cat it will be bored and stop trying. What the typical wife does when she marries beta billy. He turns into a blue pill faggot and she loses attraction.. If you put the string too far away from the cat it wont try to chase it. You must keep the string just out of reach of the cat and tease it. Keep the attraction going, drive bys, DHVs, teasing like shes your bratty little sister, kino, Fuck with her mind..always.\n\nNow more than ever, keep her mind busy or she fill it in with a bunch of nonsense. 100% chance it will be directly proportional to money too. Your wallet will pay for it. More than ever, women are in competition with each other to display their resources. I know dudes not getting laid but getting suckered/ shamed into expensive kitchen upgrades, building pools, etc. all because theyre failing to guide their wives during this time. Women stay plugged in and spend all fucking day long on instafuck, fuckBook, tik-fucking-tok these days comparing and contrasting their resources with other women, if you arent providing the tingles or feelz, shell start bitching about the next expensive home renovation or vacation that she REALLY needs.\n\nKeep your emotions in check. Dont show weakness, save it for your bros or keep to yourself. She doesnt give a fuck about you. She only cares how you make HER feelz. Keep your DHVs going. Also keep the illusion of work going. Never break Kayfab. Pro wrestlers never give the act away no matter how silly it is... Always stay in character. Even if youre considered non essential at work, she doesnt need to know that. You just got promoted congratulations. Let her know the important work youre doing. Tell her about the task force you were just assigned to. Wear a fucking headset and act busy as fuck during the day at your laptop. Print out a schedule and mark it the fuck up and tape it on the wall. Get dressed for your skype presentation. If you have free time, start a side business online. Women are attracted to high status and value. Must keep your high value going. If you appear to be doing nothing all fucking day long shell dry up. Let her see all your work wives emailing and texting you. Keep giving the gift of Dread. Let her see how much they miss working with you in the office.\n\nWhat have you done for me lately? They dont give a fuck that you took them on that expensive vacation last summer, what did you do for them right now? Always add right now after everything they say to give it context. Woman are always after more resources, trinkets, and prizes.\n\nDont get lured into arguments if she says you never do this or that. You never take me on such and such vacation - youre right, I reserve those for my girlfriends smile and grin. Keep AA at all times. Shes flooded with emotions right now, bet your ass youll be shit tested. Dont take the bait. Lead her. I ordered from XYZ restaurant, Im leaving to pick it up have the kids ready when I get back. Im grilling steaks tonight so go ice down the beer. Dont ask what she wants.\n\nTake her on a virtual trip. Everyday around lunchtime, I take her out on the back patio. No kids allowed. Tell those little assholes to stay inside. MCT bought a bottle of red and bottle of white, told her to get her ass out on the back patio. We watched some videos on Napa valley.. travel channel, etc have fun, joke around. NLP terms its called future pacing.\n\nTalk about the future and what you plan on doing. Keeps her childlike and gets her into her hindbrain and out of her mommy mode forebrain. She feelz stressed from the kids, work, and all the Karens out there. Take her on a virtual trip and learn about these new places. Youre doing this for you, shes welcomed to join you. Let her feelz your strength, confidence, and DGAS attitude. Watch when she post pics of the 2 wine glasses on fuckBook and how all the other women swoon over what you created for her. Dont compete with anyone, let them compete with you.\n\nKeep Prizing yourself. Be the Prize- by Prizing yourself. This is a great old school Swing Cat PUA move. Guy is a legend. Make it seem she is trying to win you over. Tease her, neg her. Did you just come over here to flirt with me? Keep that up babe, youre earning points with me. First time I told my wife she was earning points with me was at a party with her friends. They couldnt believe I said that. IOIs and all over me for the rest of the night. Also the opposite of that is good too-, babe, youre losing points with me- if she drops something. Cheeky smirk, ass slap, walk away.\n\nA healthy marriage is one where she submits to you - you have to keep a higher value then her. Doesnt work the other way around despite what mainstream advice says. Best marriage is one where your balls remain empty. Must have male and female polarity for it to work. You cant be a walking doormat.\n\nKeep your T levels up. Dont eat shit all day. Workout, pushups, chin-ups, squats, walk around the block,. Punch yourself in the balls if you have to. Stop fapping like a bitch. Low T level, means being weak, means not leading, means bitching wife, means No sex, means expensive kitchens in your future.\n\nDont be a lazy piece of shit. After your work is done for the day, for fucks sake clean up. Do yard work, pressure wash, clean all the shit up youve been neglecting the past year. Dont lose your day gaming skills -Im not talking about fortnite either you faggots. Revisit the basics and why it works.\n\nReframe everything. This is a chance to double your workouts. Clean the fucking house. Spend more time enjoying your kids. More time honing your skills. More time to fuck.\n\nCool, calm, and collective. Dont be a keyboard jockey these days. Dont become obsessed with politics and the news. Check it once a day to stay informed. But stop being a bitch about it. That shit is purposely designed to make you feelz powerless. Conquer and divide tactics. Theyre pitting sides against each other.\n\nA grown man doesnt get angry over politics. It makes you look extremely unattractive. Its a weak example for your son too. Its a victim mindset. Shows that you arent the center of origin.\n\nWhen is the last time you got a great blow job? Strong powerful man get great blow jobs. Say what you want about Bill Clinton, this dude was a champ at BJs. Go watch YouTube videos of him playing Mayor Game  how he just owned a room when he walked in.. dude could drop panties like no other. .\n\nHow you act today will remain with you for the rest of your life. Did you get shit done? Act like a little bitch? Failed to lead? Fail to help your kids?Did you work on yourself? Did you set goals and start action towards them?Become the King. The king doesnt complain or whine to the queen. When you act like a King, you start getting treated like a King.

Women are preprogrammed to reward their prize with sex.\n\nI use to blame everything and everyone out there. I blamed the weather, politics, the company, company policy, mission statement, the economy, the news, the president, the party in power. Its a fucking lie. You were lied to. Its all a set up.

Despite what she says about being stressed with homeschooling the kids or adjusting to telework at home, lack of attraction is why you arent getting laid. Its also why she is acting like a sexless cunt and bitchy first mate right now. I already see it happening to friends and coworkers.\n\nLook, if you aint Gaming, you aint Fucking. MRP is red pill on hard mode because you have to find a way to game the same woman every day. Once you find it, you must internalize it as your own so it flows out naturally.\n\nEspecially now, she is seeing you all the time. All of your weaknesses are magnified. For you fat beta fucks, its like trying to light a fire with damp wood. She simply isnt attracted to you. You arent getting laid for a reason and she is probably shaming you for even trying.\n\nIf you aint Gaming, you aint fucking. Your wife isnt yours. Its just your mother fucking turn with her. Dont be mad that Chad fucked her back in college in the foam party on spring break, he earned it. He gamed her. She thought he was hot. She didnt need an emotional connection.\n\nMysterys Cat String Theory still applies. If you just give the string to the cat it will be bored and stop trying. What the typical wife does when she marries beta billy. He turns into a blue pill faggot and she loses attraction.. If you put the string too far away from the cat it wont try to chase it. You must keep the string just out of reach of the cat and tease it. Keep the attraction going, drive bys, DHVs, teasing like shes your bratty little sister, kino, Fuck with her mind..always.\n\nNow more than ever, keep her mind busy or she fill it in with a bunch of nonsense. 100% chance it will be directly proportional to money too. Your wallet will pay for it. More than ever, women are in competition with each other to display their resources. I know dudes not getting laid but getting suckered/ shamed into expensive kitchen upgrades, building pools, etc. all because theyre failing to guide their wives during this time. Women stay plugged in and spend all fucking day long on instafuck, fuckBook, tik-fucking-tok these days comparing and contrasting their resources with other women, if you arent providing the tingles or feelz, shell start bitching about the next expensive home renovation or vacation that she REALLY needs.\n\nKeep your emotions in check. Dont show weakness, save it for your bros or keep to yourself. She doesnt give a fuck about you. She only cares how you make HER feelz. Keep your DHVs going. Also keep the illusion of work going. Never break Kayfab. Pro wrestlers never give the act away no matter how silly it is... Always stay in character. Even if youre considered non essential at work, she doesnt need to know that. You just got promoted congratulations. Let her know the important work youre doing. Tell her about the task force you were just assigned to. Wear a fucking headset and act busy as fuck during the day at your laptop. Print out a schedule and mark it the fuck up and tape it on the wall. Get dressed for your skype presentation. If you have free time, start a side business online. Women are attracted to high status and value. Must keep your high value going. If you appear to be doing nothing all fucking day long shell dry up. Let her see all your work wives emailing and texting you. Keep giving the gift of Dread. Let her see how much they miss working with you in the office.\n\nWhat have you done for me lately? They dont give a fuck that you took them on that expensive vacation last summer, what did you do for them right now? Always add right now after everything they say to give it context. Woman are always after more resources, trinkets, and prizes.\n\nDont get lured into arguments if she says you never do this or that. You never take me on such and such vacation - youre right, I reserve those for my girlfriends smile and grin. Keep AA at all times. Shes flooded with emotions right now, bet your ass youll be shit tested. Dont take the bait. Lead her. I ordered from XYZ restaurant, Im leaving to pick it up have the kids ready when I get back. Im grilling steaks tonight so go ice down the beer. Dont ask what she wants.\n\nTake her on a virtual trip. Everyday around lunchtime, I take her out on the back patio. No kids allowed. Tell those little assholes to stay inside. MCT bought a bottle of red and bottle of white, told her to get her ass out on the back patio. We watched some videos on Napa valley.. travel channel, etc have fun, joke around. NLP terms its called future pacing.\n\nTalk about the future and what you plan on doing. Keeps her childlike and gets her into her hindbrain and out of her mommy mode forebrain. She feelz stressed from the kids, work, and all the Karens out there. Take her on a virtual trip and learn about these new places. Youre doing this for you, shes welcomed to join you. Let her feelz your strength, confidence, and DGAS attitude. Watch when she post pics of the 2 wine glasses on fuckBook and how all the other women swoon over what you created for her. Dont compete with anyone, let them compete with you.\n\nKeep Prizing yourself. Be the Prize- by Prizing yourself. This is a great old school Swing Cat PUA move. Guy is a legend. Make it seem she is trying to win you over. Tease her, neg her. Did you just come over here to flirt with me? Keep that up babe, youre earning points with me. First time I told my wife she was earning points with me was at a party with her friends. They couldnt believe I said that. IOIs and all over me for the rest of the night. Also the opposite of that is good too-, babe, youre losing points with me- if she drops something. Cheeky smirk, ass slap, walk away.\n\nA healthy marriage is one where she submits to you - you have to keep a higher value then her. Doesnt work the other way around despite what mainstream advice says. Best marriage is one where your balls remain empty. Must have male and female polarity for it to work. You cant be a walking doormat.\n\nKeep your T levels up. Dont eat shit all day. Workout, pushups, chin-ups, squats, walk around the block,. Punch yourself in the balls if you have to. Stop fapping like a bitch. Low T level, means being weak, means not leading, means bitching wife, means No sex, means expensive kitchens in your future.\n\nDont be a lazy piece of shit. After your work is done for the day, for fucks sake clean up. Do yard work, pressure wash, clean all the shit up youve been neglecting the past year. Dont lose your day gaming skills -Im not talking about fortnite either you faggots. Revisit the basics and why it works.\n\nReframe everything. This is a chance to double your workouts. Clean the fucking house. Spend more time enjoying your kids. More time honing your skills. More time to fuck.\n\nCool, calm, and collective. Dont be a keyboard jockey these days. Dont become obsessed with politics and the news. Check it once a day to stay informed. But stop being a bitch about it. That shit is purposely designed to make you feelz powerless. Conquer and divide tactics. Theyre pitting sides against each other.\n\nA grown man doesnt get angry over politics. It makes you look extremely unattractive. Its a weak example for your son too. Its a victim mindset. Shows that you arent the center of origin.\n\nWhen is the last time you got a great blow job? Strong powerful man get great blow jobs. Say what you want about Bill Clinton, this dude was a champ at BJs. Go watch YouTube videos of him playing Mayor Game  how he just owned a room when he walked in.. dude could drop panties like no other. .\n\nHow you act today will remain with you for the rest of your life. Did you get shit done? Act like a little bitch? Failed to lead? Fail to help your kids?Did you work on yourself? Did you set goals and start action towards them?Become the King. The king doesnt complain or whine to the queen. When you act like a King, you start getting treated like a King.

Women are preprogrammed to reward their prize with sex.\n\nI use to blame everything and everyone out there. I blamed the weather, politics, the company, company policy, mission statement, the economy, the news, the president, the party in power. Its a fucking lie. You were lied to. Its all a set up.

Despite what she says about being stressed with homeschooling the kids or adjusting to telework at home, lack of attraction is why you arent getting laid. Its also why she is acting like a sexless cunt and bitchy first mate right now. I already see it happening to friends and coworkers.\n\nLook, if you aint Gaming, you aint Fucking. MRP is red pill on hard mode because you have to find a way to game the same woman every day. Once you find it, you must internalize it as your own so it flows out naturally.\n\nEspecially now, she is seeing you all the time. All of your weaknesses are magnified. For you fat beta fucks, its like trying to light a fire with damp wood. She simply isnt attracted to you. You arent getting laid for a reason and she is probably shaming you for even trying.\n\nIf you aint Gaming, you aint fucking. Your wife isnt yours. Its just your mother fucking turn with her. Dont be mad that Chad fucked her back in college in the foam party on spring break, he earned it. He gamed her. She thought he was hot. She didnt need an emotional connection.\n\nMysterys Cat String Theory still applies. If you just give the string to the cat it will be bored and stop trying. What the typical wife does when she marries beta billy. He turns into a blue pill faggot and she loses attraction.. If you put the string too far away from the cat it wont try to chase it. You must keep the string just out of reach of the cat and tease it. Keep the attraction going, drive bys, DHVs, teasing like shes your bratty little sister, kino, Fuck with her mind..always.\n\nNow more than ever, keep her mind busy or she fill it in with a bunch of nonsense. 100% chance it will be directly proportional to money too. Your wallet will pay for it. More than ever, women are in competition with each other to display their resources. I know dudes not getting laid but getting suckered/ shamed into expensive kitchen upgrades, building pools, etc. all because theyre failing to guide their wives during this time. Women stay plugged in and spend all fucking day long on instafuck, fuckBook, tik-fucking-tok these days comparing and contrasting their resources with other women, if you arent providing the tingles or feelz, shell start bitching about the next expensive home renovation or vacation that she REALLY needs.\n\nKeep your emotions in check. Dont show weakness, save it for your bros or keep to yourself. She doesnt give a fuck about you. She only cares how you make HER feelz. Keep your DHVs going. Also keep the illusion of work going. Never break Kayfab. Pro wrestlers never give the act away no matter how silly it is... Always stay in character. Even if youre considered non essential at work, she doesnt need to know that. You just got promoted congratulations. Let her know the important work youre doing. Tell her about the task force you were just assigned to. Wear a fucking headset and act busy as fuck during the day at your laptop. Print out a schedule and mark it the fuck up and tape it on the wall. Get dressed for your skype presentation. If you have free time, start a side business online. Women are attracted to high status and value. Must keep your high value going. If you appear to be doing nothing all fucking day long shell dry up. Let her see all your work wives emailing and texting you. Keep giving the gift of Dread. Let her see how much they miss working with you in the office.\n\nWhat have you done for me lately? They dont give a fuck that you took them on that expensive vacation last summer, what did you do for them right now? Always add right now after everything they say to give it context. Woman are always after more resources, trinkets, and prizes.\n\nDont get lured into arguments if she says you never do this or that. You never take me on such and such vacation - youre right, I reserve those for my girlfriends smile and grin. Keep AA at all times. Shes flooded with emotions right now, bet your ass youll be shit tested. Dont take the bait. Lead her. I ordered from XYZ restaurant, Im leaving to pick it up have the kids ready when I get back. Im grilling steaks tonight so go ice down the beer. Dont ask what she wants.\n\nTake her on a virtual trip. Everyday around lunchtime, I take her out on the back patio. No kids allowed. Tell those little assholes to stay inside. MCT bought a bottle of red and bottle of white, told her to get her ass out on the back patio. We watched some videos on Napa valley.. travel channel, etc have fun, joke around. NLP terms its called future pacing.\n\nTalk about the future and what you plan on doing. Keeps her childlike and gets her into her hindbrain and out of her mommy mode forebrain. She feelz stressed from the kids, work, and all the Karens out there. Take her on a virtual trip and learn about these new places. Youre doing this for you, shes welcomed to join you. Let her feelz your strength, confidence, and DGAS attitude. Watch when she post pics of the 2 wine glasses on fuckBook and how all the other women swoon over what you created for her. Dont compete with anyone, let them compete with you.\n\nKeep Prizing yourself. Be the Prize- by Prizing yourself. This is a great old school Swing Cat PUA move. Guy is a legend. Make it seem she is trying to win you over. Tease her, neg her. Did you just come over here to flirt with me? Keep that up babe, youre earning points with me. First time I told my wife she was earning points with me was at a party with her friends. They couldnt believe I said that. IOIs and all over me for the rest of the night. Also the opposite of that is good too-, babe, youre losing points with me- if she drops something. Cheeky smirk, ass slap, walk away.\n\nA healthy marriage is one where she submits to you - you have to keep a higher value then her. Doesnt work the other way around despite what mainstream advice says. Best marriage is one where your balls remain empty. Must have male and female polarity for it to work. You cant be a walking doormat.\n\nKeep your T levels up. Dont eat shit all day. Workout, pushups, chin-ups, squats, walk around the block,. Punch yourself in the balls if you have to. Stop fapping like a bitch. Low T level, means being weak, means not leading, means bitching wife, means No sex, means expensive kitchens in your future.\n\nDont be a lazy piece of shit. After your work is done for the day, for fucks sake clean up. Do yard work, pressure wash, clean all the shit up youve been neglecting the past year. Dont lose your day gaming skills -Im not talking about fortnite either you faggots. Revisit the basics and why it works.\n\nReframe everything. This is a chance to double your workouts. Clean the fucking house. Spend more time enjoying your kids. More time honing your skills. More time to fuck.\n\nCool, calm, and collective. Dont be a keyboard jockey these days. Dont become obsessed with politics and the news. Check it once a day to stay informed. But stop being a bitch about it. That shit is purposely designed to make you feelz powerless. Conquer and divide tactics. Theyre pitting sides against each other.\n\nA grown man doesnt get angry over politics. It makes you look extremely unattractive. Its a weak example for your son too. Its a victim mindset. Shows that you arent the center of origin.\n\nWhen is the last time you got a great blow job? Strong powerful man get great blow jobs. Say what you want about Bill Clinton, this dude was a champ at BJs. Go watch YouTube videos of him playing Mayor Game  how he just owned a room when he walked in.. dude could drop panties like no other. .\n\nHow you act today will remain with you for the rest of your life. Did you get shit done? Act like a little bitch? Failed to lead? Fail to help your kids?Did you work on yourself? Did you set goals and start action towards them?Become the King. The king doesnt complain or whine to the queen. When you act like a King, you start getting treated like a King.

Women are preprogrammed to reward their prize with sex.\n\nI use to blame everything and everyone out there. I blamed the weather, politics, the company, company policy, mission statement, the economy, the news, the president, the party in power. Its a fucking lie. You were lied to. Its all a set up.

Despite what she says about being stressed with homeschooling the kids or adjusting to telework at home, lack of attraction is why you arent getting laid. Its also why she is acting like a sexless cunt and bitchy first mate right now. I already see it happening to friends and coworkers.\n\nLook, if you aint Gaming, you aint Fucking. MRP is red pill on hard mode because you have to find a way to game the same woman every day. Once you find it, you must internalize it as your own so it flows out naturally.\n\nEspecially now, she is seeing you all the time. All of your weaknesses are magnified. For you fat beta fucks, its like trying to light a fire with damp wood. She simply isnt attracted to you. You arent getting laid for a reason and she is probably shaming you for even trying.\n\nIf you aint Gaming, you aint fucking. Your wife isnt yours. Its just your mother fucking turn with her. Dont be mad that Chad fucked her back in college in the foam party on spring break, he earned it. He gamed her. She thought he was hot. She didnt need an emotional connection.\n\nMysterys Cat String Theory still applies. If you just give the string to the cat it will be bored and stop trying. What the typical wife does when she marries beta billy. He turns into a blue pill faggot and she loses attraction.. If you put the string too far away from the cat it wont try to chase it. You must keep the string just out of reach of the cat and tease it. Keep the attraction going, drive bys, DHVs, teasing like shes your bratty little sister, kino, Fuck with her mind..always.\n\nNow more than ever, keep her mind busy or she fill it in with a bunch of nonsense. 100% chance it will be directly proportional to money too. Your wallet will pay for it. More than ever, women are in competition with each other to display their resources. I know dudes not getting laid but getting suckered/ shamed into expensive kitchen upgrades, building pools, etc. all because theyre failing to guide their wives during this time. Women stay plugged in and spend all fucking day long on instafuck, fuckBook, tik-fucking-tok these days comparing and contrasting their resources with other women, if you arent providing the tingles or feelz, shell start bitching about the next expensive home renovation or vacation that she REALLY needs.\n\nKeep your emotions in check. Dont show weakness, save it for your bros or keep to yourself. She doesnt give a fuck about you. She only cares how you make HER feelz. Keep your DHVs going. Also keep the illusion of work going. Never break Kayfab. Pro wrestlers never give the act away no matter how silly it is... Always stay in character. Even if youre considered non essential at work, she doesnt need to know that. You just got promoted congratulations. Let her know the important work youre doing. Tell her about the task force you were just assigned to. Wear a fucking headset and act busy as fuck during the day at your laptop. Print out a schedule and mark it the fuck up and tape it on the wall. Get dressed for your skype presentation. If you have free time, start a side business online. Women are attracted to high status and value. Must keep your high value going. If you appear to be doing nothing all fucking day long shell dry up. Let her see all your work wives emailing and texting you. Keep giving the gift of Dread. Let her see how much they miss working with you in the office.\n\nWhat have you done for me lately? They dont give a fuck that you took them on that expensive vacation last summer, what did you do for them right now? Always add right now after everything they say to give it context. Woman are always after more resources, trinkets, and prizes.\n\nDont get lured into arguments if she says you never do this or that. You never take me on such and such vacation - youre right, I reserve those for my girlfriends smile and grin. Keep AA at all times. Shes flooded with emotions right now, bet your ass youll be shit tested. Dont take the bait. Lead her. I ordered from XYZ restaurant, Im leaving to pick it up have the kids ready when I get back. Im grilling steaks tonight so go ice down the beer. Dont ask what she wants.\n\nTake her on a virtual trip. Everyday around lunchtime, I take her out on the back patio. No kids allowed. Tell those little assholes to stay inside. MCT bought a bottle of red and bottle of white, told her to get her ass out on the back patio. We watched some videos on Napa valley.. travel channel, etc have fun, joke around. NLP terms its called future pacing.\n\nTalk about the future and what you plan on doing. Keeps her childlike and gets her into her hindbrain and out of her mommy mode forebrain. She feelz stressed from the kids, work, and all the Karens out there. Take her on a virtual trip and learn about these new places. Youre doing this for you, shes welcomed to join you. Let her feelz your strength, confidence, and DGAS attitude. Watch when she post pics of the 2 wine glasses on fuckBook and how all the other women swoon over what you created for her. Dont compete with anyone, let them compete with you.\n\nKeep Prizing yourself. Be the Prize- by Prizing yourself. This is a great old school Swing Cat PUA move. Guy is a legend. Make it seem she is trying to win you over. Tease her, neg her. Did you just come over here to flirt with me? Keep that up babe, youre earning points with me. First time I told my wife she was earning points with me was at a party with her friends. They couldnt believe I said that. IOIs and all over me for the rest of the night. Also the opposite of that is good too-, babe, youre losing points with me- if she drops something. Cheeky smirk, ass slap, walk away.\n\nA healthy marriage is one where she submits to you - you have to keep a higher value then her. Doesnt work the other way around despite what mainstream advice says. Best marriage is one where your balls remain empty. Must have male and female polarity for it to work. You cant be a walking doormat.\n\nKeep your T levels up. Dont eat shit all day. Workout, pushups, chin-ups, squats, walk around the block,. Punch yourself in the balls if you have to. Stop fapping like a bitch. Low T level, means being weak, means not leading, means bitching wife, means No sex, means expensive kitchens in your future.\n\nDont be a lazy piece of shit. After your work is done for the day, for fucks sake clean up. Do yard work, pressure wash, clean all the shit up youve been neglecting the past year. Dont lose your day gaming skills -Im not talking about fortnite either you faggots. Revisit the basics and why it works.\n\nReframe everything. This is a chance to double your workouts. Clean the fucking house. Spend more time enjoying your kids. More time honing your skills. More time to fuck.\n\nCool, calm, and collective. Dont be a keyboard jockey these days. Dont become obsessed with politics and the news. Check it once a day to stay informed. But stop being a bitch about it. That shit is purposely designed to make you feelz powerless. Conquer and divide tactics. Theyre pitting sides against each other.\n\nA grown man doesnt get angry over politics. It makes you look extremely unattractive. Its a weak example for your son too. Its a victim mindset. Shows that you arent the center of origin.\n\nWhen is the last time you got a great blow job? Strong powerful man get great blow jobs. Say what you want about Bill Clinton, this dude was a champ at BJs. Go watch YouTube videos of him playing Mayor Game  how he just owned a room when he walked in.. dude could drop panties like no other. .\n\nHow you act today will remain with you for the rest of your life. Did you get shit done? Act like a little bitch? Failed to lead? Fail to help your kids?Did you work on yourself? Did you set goals and start action towards them?Become the King. The king doesnt complain or whine to the queen. When you act like a King, you start getting treated like a King.

Women are preprogrammed to reward their prize with sex.\n\nI use to blame everything and everyone out there. I blamed the weather, politics, the company, company policy, mission statement, the economy, the news, the president, the party in power. Its a fucking lie. You were lied to. Its all a set up.

Despite what she says about being stressed with homeschooling the kids or adjusting to telework at home, lack of attraction is why you arent getting laid. Its also why she is acting like a sexless cunt and bitchy first mate right now. I already see it happening to friends and coworkers.\n\nLook, if you aint Gaming, you aint Fucking. MRP is red pill on hard mode because you have to find a way to game the same woman every day. Once you find it, you must internalize it as your own so it flows out naturally.\n\nEspecially now, she is seeing you all the time. All of your weaknesses are magnified. For you fat beta fucks, its like trying to light a fire with damp wood. She simply isnt attracted to you. You arent getting laid for a reason and she is probably shaming you for even trying.\n\nIf you aint Gaming, you aint fucking. Your wife isnt yours. Its just your mother fucking turn with her. Dont be mad that Chad fucked her back in college in the foam party on spring break, he earned it. He gamed her. She thought he was hot. She didnt need an emotional connection.\n\nMysterys Cat String Theory still applies. If you just give the string to the cat it will be bored and stop trying. What the typical wife does when she marries beta billy. He turns into a blue pill faggot and she loses attraction.. If you put the string too far away from the cat it wont try to chase it. You must keep the string just out of reach of the cat and tease it. Keep the attraction going, drive bys, DHVs, teasing like shes your bratty little sister, kino, Fuck with her mind..always.\n\nNow more than ever, keep her mind busy or she fill it in with a bunch of nonsense. 100% chance it will be directly proportional to money too. Your wallet will pay for it. More than ever, women are in competition with each other to display their resources. I know dudes not getting laid but getting suckered/ shamed into expensive kitchen upgrades, building pools, etc. all because theyre failing to guide their wives during this time. Women stay plugged in and spend all fucking day long on instafuck, fuckBook, tik-fucking-tok these days comparing and contrasting their resources with other women, if you arent providing the tingles or feelz, shell start bitching about the next expensive home renovation or vacation that she REALLY needs.\n\nKeep your emotions in check. Dont show weakness, save it for your bros or keep to yourself. She doesnt give a fuck about you. She only cares how you make HER feelz. Keep your DHVs going. Also keep the illusion of work going. Never break Kayfab. Pro wrestlers never give the act away no matter how silly it is... Always stay in character. Even if youre considered non essential at work, she doesnt need to know that. You just got promoted congratulations. Let her know the important work youre doing. Tell her about the task force you were just assigned to. Wear a fucking headset and act busy as fuck during the day at your laptop. Print out a schedule and mark it the fuck up and tape it on the wall. Get dressed for your skype presentation. If you have free time, start a side business online. Women are attracted to high status and value. Must keep your high value going. If you appear to be doing nothing all fucking day long shell dry up. Let her see all your work wives emailing and texting you. Keep giving the gift of Dread. Let her see how much they miss working with you in the office.\n\nWhat have you done for me lately? They dont give a fuck that you took them on that expensive vacation last summer, what did you do for them right now? Always add right now after everything they say to give it context. Woman are always after more resources, trinkets, and prizes.\n\nDont get lured into arguments if she says you never do this or that. You never take me on such and such vacation - youre right, I reserve those for my girlfriends smile and grin. Keep AA at all times. Shes flooded with emotions right now, bet your ass youll be shit tested. Dont take the bait. Lead her. I ordered from XYZ restaurant, Im leaving to pick it up have the kids ready when I get back. Im grilling steaks tonight so go ice down the beer. Dont ask what she wants.\n\nTake her on a virtual trip. Everyday around lunchtime, I take her out on the back patio. No kids allowed. Tell those little assholes to stay inside. MCT bought a bottle of red and bottle of white, told her to get her ass out on the back patio. We watched some videos on Napa valley.. travel channel, etc have fun, joke around. NLP terms its called future pacing.\n\nTalk about the future and what you plan on doing. Keeps her childlike and gets her into her hindbrain and out of her mommy mode forebrain. She feelz stressed from the kids, work, and all the Karens out there. Take her on a virtual trip and learn about these new places. Youre doing this for you, shes welcomed to join you. Let her feelz your strength, confidence, and DGAS attitude. Watch when she post pics of the 2 wine glasses on fuckBook and how all the other women swoon over what you created for her. Dont compete with anyone, let them compete with you.\n\nKeep Prizing yourself. Be the Prize- by Prizing yourself. This is a great old school Swing Cat PUA move. Guy is a legend. Make it seem she is trying to win you over. Tease her, neg her. Did you just come over here to flirt with me? Keep that up babe, youre earning points with me. First time I told my wife she was earning points with me was at a party with her friends. They couldnt believe I said that. IOIs and all over me for the rest of the night. Also the opposite of that is good too-, babe, youre losing points with me- if she drops something. Cheeky smirk, ass slap, walk away.\n\nA healthy marriage is one where she submits to you - you have to keep a higher value then her. Doesnt work the other way around despite what mainstream advice says. Best marriage is one where your balls remain empty. Must have male and female polarity for it to work. You cant be a walking doormat.\n\nKeep your T levels up. Dont eat shit all day. Workout, pushups, chin-ups, squats, walk around the block,. Punch yourself in the balls if you have to. Stop fapping like a bitch. Low T level, means being weak, means not leading, means bitching wife, means No sex, means expensive kitchens in your future.\n\nDont be a lazy piece of shit. After your work is done for the day, for fucks sake clean up. Do yard work, pressure wash, clean all the shit up youve been neglecting the past year. Dont lose your day gaming skills -Im not talking about fortnite either you faggots. Revisit the basics and why it works.\n\nReframe everything. This is a chance to double your workouts. Clean the fucking house. Spend more time enjoying your kids. More time honing your skills. More time to fuck.\n\nCool, calm, and collective. Dont be a keyboard jockey these days. Dont become obsessed with politics and the news. Check it once a day to stay informed. But stop being a bitch about it. That shit is purposely designed to make you feelz powerless. Conquer and divide tactics. Theyre pitting sides against each other.\n\nA grown man doesnt get angry over politics. It makes you look extremely unattractive. Its a weak example for your son too. Its a victim mindset. Shows that you arent the center of origin.\n\nWhen is the last time you got a great blow job? Strong powerful man get great blow jobs. Say what you want about Bill Clinton, this dude was a champ at BJs. Go watch YouTube videos of him playing Mayor Game  how he just owned a room when he walked in.. dude could drop panties like no other. .\n\nHow you act today will remain with you for the rest of your life. Did you get shit done? Act like a little bitch? Failed to lead? Fail to help your kids?Did you work on yourself? Did you set goals and start action towards them?Become the King. The king doesnt complain or whine to the queen. When you act like a King, you start getting treated like a King.

Women are preprogrammed to reward their prize with sex.\n\nI use to blame everything and everyone out there. I blamed the weather, politics, the company, company policy, mission statement, the economy, the news, the president, the party in power. Its a fucking lie. You were lied to. Its all a set up.

Despite what she says about being stressed with homeschooling the kids or adjusting to telework at home, lack of attraction is why you arent getting laid. Its also why she is acting like a sexless cunt and bitchy first mate right now. I already see it happening to friends and coworkers.\n\nLook, if you aint Gaming, you aint Fucking. MRP is red pill on hard mode because you have to find a way to game the same woman every day. Once you find it, you must internalize it as your own so it flows out naturally.\n\nEspecially now, she is seeing you all the time. All of your weaknesses are magnified. For you fat beta fucks, its like trying to light a fire with damp wood. She simply isnt attracted to you. You arent getting laid for a reason and she is probably shaming you for even trying.\n\nIf you aint Gaming, you aint fucking. Your wife isnt yours. Its just your mother fucking turn with her. Dont be mad that Chad fucked her back in college in the foam party on spring break, he earned it. He gamed her. She thought he was hot. She didnt need an emotional connection.\n\nMysterys Cat String Theory still applies. If you just give the string to the cat it will be bored and stop trying. What the typical wife does when she marries beta billy. He turns into a blue pill faggot and she loses attraction.. If you put the string too far away from the cat it wont try to chase it. You must keep the string just out of reach of the cat and tease it. Keep the attraction going, drive bys, DHVs, teasing like shes your bratty little sister, kino, Fuck with her mind..always.\n\nNow more than ever, keep her mind busy or she fill it in with a bunch of nonsense. 100% chance it will be directly proportional to money too. Your wallet will pay for it. More than ever, women are in competition with each other to display their resources. I know dudes not getting laid but getting suckered/ shamed into expensive kitchen upgrades, building pools, etc. all because theyre failing to guide their wives during this time. Women stay plugged in and spend all fucking day long on instafuck, fuckBook, tik-fucking-tok these days comparing and contrasting their resources with other women, if you arent providing the tingles or feelz, shell start bitching about the next expensive home renovation or vacation that she REALLY needs.\n\nKeep your emotions in check. Dont show weakness, save it for your bros or keep to yourself. She doesnt give a fuck about you. She only cares how you make HER feelz. Keep your DHVs going. Also keep the illusion of work going. Never break Kayfab. Pro wrestlers never give the act away no matter how silly it is... Always stay in character. Even if youre considered non essential at work, she doesnt need to know that. You just got promoted congratulations. Let her know the important work youre doing. Tell her about the task force you were just assigned to. Wear a fucking headset and act busy as fuck during the day at your laptop. Print out a schedule and mark it the fuck up and tape it on the wall. Get dressed for your skype presentation. If you have free time, start a side business online. Women are attracted to high status and value. Must keep your high value going. If you appear to be doing nothing all fucking day long shell dry up. Let her see all your work wives emailing and texting you. Keep giving the gift of Dread. Let her see how much they miss working with you in the office.\n\nWhat have you done for me lately? They dont give a fuck that you took them on that expensive vacation last summer, what did you do for them right now? Always add right now after everything they say to give it context. Woman are always after more resources, trinkets, and prizes.\n\nDont get lured into arguments if she says you never do this or that. You never take me on such and such vacation - youre right, I reserve those for my girlfriends smile and grin. Keep AA at all times. Shes flooded with emotions right now, bet your ass youll be shit tested. Dont take the bait. Lead her. I ordered from XYZ restaurant, Im leaving to pick it up have the kids ready when I get back. Im grilling steaks tonight so go ice down the beer. Dont ask what she wants.\n\nTake her on a virtual trip. Everyday around lunchtime, I take her out on the back patio. No kids allowed. Tell those little assholes to stay inside. MCT bought a bottle of red and bottle of white, told her to get her ass out on the back patio. We watched some videos on Napa valley.. travel channel, etc have fun, joke around. NLP terms its called future pacing.\n\nTalk about the future and what you plan on doing. Keeps her childlike and gets her into her hindbrain and out of her mommy mode forebrain. She feelz stressed from the kids, work, and all the Karens out there. Take her on a virtual trip and learn about these new places. Youre doing this for you, shes welcomed to join you. Let her feelz your strength, confidence, and DGAS attitude. Watch when she post pics of the 2 wine glasses on fuckBook and how all the other women swoon over what you created for her. Dont compete with anyone, let them compete with you.\n\nKeep Prizing yourself. Be the Prize- by Prizing yourself. This is a great old school Swing Cat PUA move. Guy is a legend. Make it seem she is trying to win you over. Tease her, neg her. Did you just come over here to flirt with me? Keep that up babe, youre earning points with me. First time I told my wife she was earning points with me was at a party with her friends. They couldnt believe I said that. IOIs and all over me for the rest of the night. Also the opposite of that is good too-, babe, youre losing points with me- if she drops something. Cheeky smirk, ass slap, walk away.\n\nA healthy marriage is one where she submits to you - you have to keep a higher value then her. Doesnt work the other way around despite what mainstream advice says. Best marriage is one where your balls remain empty. Must have male and female polarity for it to work. You cant be a walking doormat.\n\nKeep your T levels up. Dont eat shit all day. Workout, pushups, chin-ups, squats, walk around the block,. Punch yourself in the balls if you have to. Stop fapping like a bitch. Low T level, means being weak, means not leading, means bitching wife, means No sex, means expensive kitchens in your future.\n\nDont be a lazy piece of shit. After your work is done for the day, for fucks sake clean up. Do yard work, pressure wash, clean all the shit up youve been neglecting the past year. Dont lose your day gaming skills -Im not talking about fortnite either you faggots. Revisit the basics and why it works.\n\nReframe everything. This is a chance to double your workouts. Clean the fucking house. Spend more time enjoying your kids. More time honing your skills. More time to fuck.\n\nCool, calm, and collective. Dont be a keyboard jockey these days. Dont become obsessed with politics and the news. Check it once a day to stay informed. But stop being a bitch about it. That shit is purposely designed to make you feelz powerless. Conquer and divide tactics. Theyre pitting sides against each other.\n\nA grown man doesnt get angry over politics. It makes you look extremely unattractive. Its a weak example for your son too. Its a victim mindset. Shows that you arent the center of origin.\n\nWhen is the last time you got a great blow job? Strong powerful man get great blow jobs. Say what you want about Bill Clinton, this dude was a champ at BJs. Go watch YouTube videos of him playing Mayor Game  how he just owned a room when he walked in.. dude could drop panties like no other. .\n\nHow you act today will remain with you for the rest of your life. Did you get shit done? Act like a little bitch? Failed to lead? Fail to help your kids?Did you work on yourself? Did you set goals and start action towards them?Become the King. The king doesnt complain or whine to the queen. When you act like a King, you start getting treated like a King.

Women are preprogrammed to reward their prize with sex.\n\nI use to blame everything and everyone out there. I blamed the weather, politics, the company, company policy, mission statement, the economy, the news, the president, the party in power. Its a fucking lie. You were lied to. Its all a set up. Its a joke.\n\nYou are the only one to blame. The world is abundant. You are the key to your better future.\n\nIf you aint gaming, you aint fucking.\n\nBe safe.\n\nMTC",

            "body": "MCT Rules for PandemicsHi Faggots, Social Distancing is killing most of you betas out there. Despite what she says about being stressed with homeschooling the kids or adjusting to telework at home, lack of attraction is why you arent getting laid. Its also why she is acting like a sexless cunt and bitchy first mate right now. I already see it happening to friends and coworkers.\n\nLook, if you aint Gaming, you aint Fucking. MRP is red pill on hard mode because you have to find a way to game the same woman every day. Once you find it, you must internalize it as your own so it flows out naturally.\n\nEspecially now, she is seeing you all the time. All of your weaknesses are magnified. For you fat beta fucks, its like trying to light a fire with damp wood. She simply isnt attracted to you. You arent getting laid for a reason and she is probably shaming you for even trying.\n\nIf you aint Gaming, you aint fucking. Your wife isnt yours. Its just your mother fucking turn with her. Dont be mad that Chad fucked her back in college in the foam party on spring break, he earned it. He gamed her. She thought he was hot. She didnt need an emotional connection.\n\nMysterys Cat String Theory still applies. If you just give the string to the cat it will be bored and stop trying. What the typical wife does when she marries beta billy. He turns into a blue pill faggot and she loses attraction.. If you put the string too far away from the cat it wont try to chase it. You must keep the string just out of reach of the cat and tease it. Keep the attraction going, drive bys, DHVs, teasing like shes your bratty little sister, kino, Fuck with her mind..always.\n\nNow more than ever, keep her mind busy or she fill it in with a bunch of nonsense. 100% chance it will be directly proportional to money too. Your wallet will pay for it. More than ever, women are in competition with each other to display their resources. I know dudes not getting laid but getting suckered/ shamed into expensive kitchen upgrades, building pools, etc. all because theyre failing to guide their wives during this time. Women stay plugged in and spend all fucking day long on instafuck, fuckBook, tik-fucking-tok these days comparing and contrasting their resources with other women, if you arent providing the tingles or feelz, shell start bitching about the next expensive home renovation or vacation that she REALLY needs.\n\nKeep your emotions in check. Dont show weakness, save it for your bros or keep to yourself. She doesnt give a fuck about you. She only cares how you make HER feelz. Keep your DHVs going. Also keep the illusion of work going. Never break Kayfab. Pro wrestlers never give the act away no matter how silly it is... Always stay in character. Even if youre considered non essential at work, she doesnt need to know that. You just got promoted congratulations. Let her know the important work youre doing. Tell her about the task force you were just assigned to. Wear a fucking headset and act busy as fuck during the day at your laptop. Print out a schedule and mark it the fuck up and tape it on the wall. Get dressed for your skype presentation. If you have free time, start a side business online. Women are attracted to high status and value. Must keep your high value going. If you appear to be doing nothing all fucking day long shell dry up. Let her see all your work wives emailing and texting you. Keep giving the gift of Dread. Let her see how much they miss working with you in the office.\n\nWhat have you done for me lately? They dont give a fuck that you took them on that expensive vacation last summer, what did you do for them right now? Always add right now after everything they say to give it context. Woman are always after more resources, trinkets, and prizes.\n\nDont get lured into arguments if she says you never do this or that. You never take me on such and such vacation - youre right, I reserve those for my girlfriends smile and grin. Keep AA at all times. Shes flooded with emotions right now, bet your ass youll be shit tested. Dont take the bait. Lead her. I ordered from XYZ restaurant, Im leaving to pick it up have the kids ready when I get back. Im grilling steaks tonight so go ice down the beer. Dont ask what she wants.\n\nTake her on a virtual trip. Everyday around lunchtime, I take her out on the back patio. No kids allowed. Tell those little assholes to stay inside. MCT bought a bottle of red and bottle of white, told her to get her ass out on the back patio. We watched some videos on Napa valley.. travel channel, etc have fun, joke around. NLP terms its called future pacing.\n\nTalk about the future and what you plan on doing. Keeps her childlike and gets her into her hindbrain and out of her mommy mode forebrain. She feelz stressed from the kids, work, and all the Karens out there. Take her on a virtual trip and learn about these new places. Youre doing this for you, shes welcomed to join you. Let her feelz your strength, confidence, and DGAS attitude. Watch when she post pics of the 2 wine glasses on fuckBook and how all the other women swoon over what you created for her. Dont compete with anyone, let them compete with you.\n\nKeep Prizing yourself. Be the Prize- by Prizing yourself. This is a great old school Swing Cat PUA move. Guy is a legend. Make it seem she is trying to win you over. Tease her, neg her. Did you just come over here to flirt with me? Keep that up babe, youre earning points with me. First time I told my wife she was earning points with me was at a party with her friends. They couldnt believe I said that. IOIs and all over me for the rest of the night. Also the opposite of that is good too-, babe, youre losing points with me- if she drops something. Cheeky smirk, ass slap, walk away.\n\nA healthy marriage is one where she submits to you - you have to keep a higher value then her. Doesnt work the other way around despite what mainstream advice says. Best marriage is one where your balls remain empty. Must have male and female polarity for it to work. You cant be a walking doormat.\n\nKeep your T levels up. Dont eat shit all day. Workout, pushups, chin-ups, squats, walk around the block,. Punch yourself in the balls if you have to. Stop fapping like a bitch. Low T level, means being weak, means not leading, means bitching wife, means No sex, means expensive kitchens in your future.\n\nDont be a lazy piece of shit. After your work is done for the day, for fucks sake clean up. Do yard work, pressure wash, clean all the shit up youve been neglecting the past year. Dont lose your day gaming skills -Im not talking about fortnite either you faggots. Revisit the basics and why it works.\n\nReframe everything. This is a chance to double your workouts. Clean the fucking house. Spend more time enjoying your kids. More time honing your skills. More time to fuck.\n\nCool, calm, and collective. Dont be a keyboard jockey these days. Dont become obsessed with politics and the news. Check it once a day to stay informed. But stop being a bitch about it. That shit is purposely designed to make you feelz powerless. Conquer and divide tactics. Theyre pitting sides against each other.\n\nA grown man doesnt get angry over politics. It makes you look extremely unattractive. Its a weak example for your son too. Its a victim mindset. Shows that you arent the center of origin.\n\nWhen is the last time you got a great blow job? Strong powerful man get great blow jobs. Say what you want about Bill Clinton, this dude was a champ at BJs. Go watch YouTube videos of him playing Mayor Game  how he just owned a room when he walked in.. dude could drop panties like no other. .\n\nHow you act today will remain with you for the rest of your life. Did you get shit done? Act like a little bitch? Failed to lead? Fail to help your kids?Did you work on yourself? Did you set goals and start action towards them?Become the King. The king doesnt complain or whine to the queen. When you act like a King, you start getting treated like a King. Women are preprogrammed to reward their prize with sex.\n\nI use to blame everything and everyone out there. I blamed the weather, politics, the company, company policy, mission statement, the economy, the news, the president, the party in power. Its a fucking lie. You were lied to. Its all a set up. Its a joke.\n\nYou are the only one to blame. The world is abundant. You are the key to your better future.\n\nIf you aint gaming, you aint fucking.\n\nBe safe.\n\nMTC",

You go to work and you dress the same as everyone else. As long as your shirt is ironed and your shoes are clean, youre good to go.\n\nYou wear the standard weekend casual wear - a pair of [ugly trainers](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81YoJmDsrlL._SR500,500_.jpg), some Dad jeans a t-shirt and plaid shirt or a hoody. Same as everyone else.\n\nFor a night out, youll switch the trainers for a [pair of shoes](https://cdn3-www.mandatory.com/assets/uploads/2015/10/bootcut-jeans-with-boots.jpg) and switch the t-shirt for a shirt. Same as everyone else.\n\nAnd if its a big night out, youll pull out your [going out shirt](https://media.gq.com/photos/5583bdb53655c24c6c96a829/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/style-blogs-the-gq-eye-untucked-dress-shirt.jpg). The one you bought 6 years ago and still wear because someone once told you that it looked good on you.\n\nYou wear a [fleece](https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/B3-BE974_MIDTOW_P_20180723175929.jpg) in winter because its cozy. You wear cargo shorts in summer because they have handy pockets. And you wear [wrap around silver tinted sunglasses](https://www.sportrx.com/sportrx-blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/blob.jpg) in summer because.... well, I have no idea why the fuck you wear them.\n\nYou never put any effort in, you dont do any research and you never go outside your comfort zone. And if youre an especially lazy cunt, you let your wife buy your clothes for you.\n\nThats OK if youre happy being a badly dressed sheep. Thats fine if youre content being an average looking Joe. Thats great if youre happy putting in zero fucking effort. But if you want to look like a man who has his shit together and looks like he actually gives a fuck, then you need to develop your own style.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# What da Fuck is Style?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Its not about matching your belt with your shoes.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Style is knowing who you are, what you want to say, and not giving a damn.*\n\n** Orson Welles**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA High Value Man has frame and lives his life according to his own values and his own standards. An integral part of these standards is his style. Style is important to him. Looking good is important to him. Smelling good is important to him. Being groomed is important to him. And not looking like his wife bought his clothes for him in Wallmart is *really fucking* important to him.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause his style is a visual representation of who he is.\n\n**It is the outward projection of his frame -** ***a visual expression of his own identity.***\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*\"Remind yourself. Nobody built like you, you design yourself.\"*\n\n**- Jay Z**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# I'm too hot  - hot damn - Called a police and a fireman\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYour style is for you to decide and when you define it, when you own it, it becomes part of who you are. You do it for yourself. But make no mistake - looking good makes your life a shit load easier  easier to get a job, easier to advance in your career, easier to win over clients, easier to develop relationships and yeah.. easier to get your dick wet.\n\nIts a value add on on every level.\n\nPeople will always make a judgement on you based your appearance. By dressing well, you are conveying a message and projecting your frame without speaking a word. Style is an instant language. Youd be a fool not to learn it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*\"It is both delusional and stupid to think that clothes don't really matter and we should all wear whatever we want. Most people don't take clothing seriously enough, but whether we should or not, clothes do talk to us and we make decisions based on people's appearances.\"*\n\n**-- G. Bruce**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Developing Your Style\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Know first who you are, and then adorn yourself accordingly.*\n\n** Epictetus**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDeveloping your own style has parallels to developing your body through lifting and proper nutrition  it doesnt happen overnight. If youve spent the first few decades of your adult life turning yourself into a waddling blob of fat, youre not going to look like a Greek God after 2 weeks. It takes time and effort.\n\nThe same applies to developing your style. Youll get noobie gains. The first time you start dressing well, people will notice, youll get compliments, youll feel great. But dont make the mistake of thinking that youve nailed it. You havent. You just bought the first half decent outfit youve worn in your adult life.\n\nAnd yes, I did say outfit. *Suck it up, Princess.*\n\nThats the learning curve. Just like lifting, the longer you spend at it, the harder you work at it, the better you get at it... until one day, youll walk by the mirror and think  fuck that dude looks good.\n\nI cant tell you what to wear no more than I can tell you how to live your life or develop your own frame. No one can. You need to decide this for yourself. If your style is the visual representation of your frame, then its *your* frame that will decide *your* style.\n\nBut there are some easy ways in which you can begin the process;\n\n \n\n# Fit is King\n\nIt doesnt matter what you are wearing or what the occasion is  be it a [business suit](https://www.fashionbeans.com/article/how-a-suit-should-fit/), a casual weekend fit or even your sweaty gym gear  fit is absolute king. It reigns supreme over everything else. Too baggy, too tight, too short, too long - ***if it doesnt fit, it will look like shit.***\n\nYou see it all the time  fat dudes [wearing baggy clothes](https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/01/22/4BBF5CDD00000578-5679953-image-a-45_1525209089551.jpg) in a pathetic attempt to hide the belly, muscular guys wearing [far too tight clothing](https://i.pinimg.com/564x/4d/b3/66/4db366dfc6e85f2b69d23e0a376f31e8.jpg) to show their gains, [skinny twats](https://vanillily2.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/1535274_lookbook.jpg) wearing skinny jeans to show how fragile their legs are, or just your middle-of-the-road average Joe wearing stuff thats cut badly, made from cheap materials, doesnt sit right and does nothing to enhance their visual appearance.\n\nNone of this shit works.\n\nSo learn how to [nail the fit](https://www.fashionbeans.com/2009/mens-fashion-basics-part-1-good-fit/) and youre halfway there already. No exaggeration  thats half the work done.\n\n \n\n# Stick to the Classics\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*\"I live for myself and I answer to nobody.\"*\n\n*** Steve McQueen***\n\nYou dont need to reinvent the wheel when developing your style. Its already been invented  all you need to do is find the pieces that you like and put them together in a cohesive way that looks good on you. *The easiest way to do this is to stick to the classics.*\n\n[Steve McQueen](https://www.google.com/search?q=steve+mcqueen+style&safe=off&rlz=1C1CHWA_enIE609IE609&sxsrf=ALeKk00SDkBW83022VgG692HJSOBJ2xhdw:1585770383558&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjH0qCD_8foAhXioXEKHcoJBfcQ_AUoAXoECBEQAw&biw=1421&bih=637) was a master at this. Hes often lauded as one of the greatest ever style icons and features repeatedly year after year in article after article in mens style magazines and blogs. And his style still looks good today. Not bad for a dude whos been dead for 40 years.\n\nIf you look at how he dressed, theres nothing complicated about it  he just stuck to classic items like polo shirts, bomber and Harrington jackets, slim fit jeans, well fitting t-shirts and perfectly fitted suits.\n\nTheres nothing try-hard about his style, nothing fancy and nothing fashion, yet he looks cool, elegant and stylish  all the while combining classic items with perfect fit. He looks equally good in a suit, in motorcycle gear or even dressed head to toe in denim. That man knew how to dress. If youre looking for a style icon to [follow](https://www.thegentlemansjournal.com/style-icon-dress-like-steve-mcqueen/), you cant go far wrong with McQueen.\n\n \n\n# Keep it Simple\n\n*Its not complicated, so dont over complicate it.*\n\nClassic items will help you keep it simple but there are other areas where you need to stick to the basics:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***Colour.***\n\nYour colour friends are  [neutrals and earthy colours](https://www.shutterstock.com/image-vector/minimalistic-color-palette-chart-vector-573720589)  black, white, navy, grey, khaki, olive, beige and brown.\n\nThats it. Stick to a basic pallete. Not only is it easy, its masculine, refined and makes it really simple to mix and match.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***Less is more***\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*All it takes are a few simple outfits. And theres one secret  the simpler the better.*\n\n** Cary Grant**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe 80/20 rule applies here. If you look in your wardrobe, I guarantee that you wear 20% of your clothes 80% of the time. That is why you dont need a massive amount of clothes. You need a [small amount of clothes](http://theessentialman.com/how-to-create-minimalist-wardrobe/) that you will get a lot of wear out of.\n\n*You dont need lots of choices; you just need the right choices.*\n\nSo learn to choose carefully  or time after time, youll be left standing in front of a wardrobe full of clothes, frustrated that you have nothing to wear. Like a bitch.\n\n# Steal from Your Icons\n\n*One pretends to do something, or copy someone or some teacher, until it can be done confidently and easily in what becomes ones own style.*\n\n** Cary Grant**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you look at any famous creative people  musicians, artists, designers, film makers  none of them are original. They have all stolen from other artists, then learned how to tweak what they liked, combined it with other bits and made it their own. A great artist is basically a magpie.\n\nDeveloping your own style is no different. So find your style icons and rip them off. Yep.. just copy them. Then tweak it & develop it until it becomes your own. Its that simple.\n\nOne of the easiest places to start is the annual Best Dressed Man of the Year Awards  the likes of [GQ](https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/gallery/best-dressed-men-2019?image=5d13a5702881ccf5620a9383) & [Fashionbeans](https://www.fashionbeans.com/article/best-dressed-men-in-the-world/) run these every year.

Well, the answer is easy  for 100 bucks, you get quality in terms of design, materials and fit that will last. For 12 bucks, you get a [poorly fitting polo](https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Essentials-Slim-Fit-Lavendar-XX-Large/dp/B07N4P9DS6/ref=sr_1_8?dchild=1&keywords=polo+shirt&qid=1585770945&sr=8-8) made from low grade materials that looks like it cost 12 bucks and - after a few washes - is worthless. One well selected costly item has much more value than ten cheap ones. Not only in how it looks but in how much bang per buck it gives you.\n\nThe difference is even greater when youre buying [outerwear](https://www.reiss.com/ie/p/suede-zip-through-jacket-mens-marlo-in-tobacco-brown/?category_id=10396&gaEeList=M%20-%20Coats%20%26%20Jackets%20-%20Leather) and [footwear](https://www.johnvarvatos.com/amsterdam-chelsea-boot/190802674933.html#start=1). These are two areas where you simply cannot skimp on. [Cheap shoes](https://www.mandmdirect.ie/01/details/SK1018?ds_rl=1262771&ds_rl=1262771&gclid=CjwKCAjw95D0BRBFEiwAcO1KDM_ckC8tttDP6BSiNmmIPFzaeMLnOJOnoIEg_3vie7tUhZsdDnv4pRoCGGkQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds) kill any outfit stone dead. [Cheap jackets](https://www.mandmdirect.ie/01/details/SK1018?ds_rl=1262771&ds_rl=1262771&gclid=CjwKCAjw95D0BRBFEiwAcO1KDM_ckC8tttDP6BSiNmmIPFzaeMLnOJOnoIEg_3vie7tUhZsdDnv4pRoCGGkQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds) are just as bad. Theres a reason why you pay more for leather, wool and cotton - its practically impossible to look good in man made synthetic materials like polyester, pleather and acrylic.\n\nIf you cant afford high quality clothes, there are numerous places and ways to get discounted quality clothing and footwear.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Shop online**\n\nA retailers job is to sell you shit you dont need  good retailers do this by maximising lighting and mirrors to make you look as good as possible when youre in the changing room. Ever tried on something in a shop, thought it looked good and when you got home realised that it looked better on in the shop? Thats why.\n\nYoure also a lot more likely to impulse buy. 3 shirts for 20 bucks on the sale rack? What a bargain. Thats 20 bucks for three shitty shirts thatll end up gathering dust in your wardrobe before you fuck them into the thrash. Yeah, real bargain.\n\nSo shop online use retailers that offer free deliveries and returns, then try on that shit in the comfort of your own home. This also allows you to try stuff on with things you already own. Theres no point in buying something that just doesnt fit into your wardrobe  youll never wear it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Never Go Full Retail**\n\nAll designers and high street shops are over-priced. Their pricing structures allow for their clothing to be sold at discount prices during sales periods and *still make a profit,* so dont pay full whack  wait for the sales, use discount codes, install the Honey add-on to your browser, sign up to newsletters for discounts, use cash back sites.\n\nOther places such as [Yoox](https://www.yoox.com/ie/men) offer designer clothes at discount prices. Youd be a fool to go full retail.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***Looking good isnt self-importance; its self-respect.***\n\n** Charles Hix**",

And if youre an especially lazy cunt, you let your wife buy your clothes for you.\n\nThats OK if youre happy being a badly dressed sheep. Thats fine if youre content being an average looking Joe. Thats great if youre happy putting in zero fucking effort.

An integral part of these standards is his style. Style is important to him. Looking good is important to him. Smelling good is important to him. Being groomed is important to him. And not looking like his wife bought his clothes for him in Wallmart is *really fucking* important to him.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause his style is a visual representation of who he is.\n\n**It is the outward projection of his frame -** ***a visual expression of his own identity.***\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*\"Remind yourself. Nobody built like you, you design yourself.\"*\n\n**- Jay Z**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# I'm too hot  - hot damn - Called a police and a fireman\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYour style is for you to decide and when you define it, when you own it, it becomes part of who you are. You do it for yourself. But make no mistake - looking good makes your life a shit load easier  easier to get a job, easier to advance in your career, easier to win over clients, easier to develop relationships and yeah.. easier to get your dick wet.\n\nIts a value add on on every level.\n\nPeople will always make a judgement on you based your appearance. By dressing well, you are conveying a message and projecting your frame without speaking a word. Style is an instant language. Youd be a fool not to learn it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*\"It is both delusional and stupid to think that clothes don't really matter and we should all wear whatever we want. Most people don't take clothing seriously enough, but whether we should or not, clothes do talk to us and we make decisions based on people's appearances.\"*\n\n**-- G.

If youve spent the first few decades of your adult life turning yourself into a waddling blob of fat, youre not going to look like a Greek God after 2 weeks. It takes time and effort.\n\nThe same applies to developing your style. Youll get noobie gains. The first time you start dressing well, people will notice, youll get compliments, youll feel great. But dont make the mistake of thinking that youve nailed it. You havent. You just bought the first half decent outfit youve worn in your adult life.\n\nAnd yes, I did say outfit. *Suck it up, Princess.*\n\nThats the learning curve. Just like lifting, the longer you spend at it, the harder you work at it, the better you get at it... until one day, youll walk by the mirror and think  fuck that dude looks good.\n\nI cant tell you what to wear no more than I can tell you how to live your life or develop your own frame. No one can. You need to decide this for yourself. If your style is the visual representation of your frame, then its *your* frame that will decide *your* style.\n\nBut there are some easy ways in which you can begin the process;\n\n \n\n# Fit is King\n\nIt doesnt matter what you are wearing or what the occasion is  be it a [business suit](https://www.fashionbeans.com/article/how-a-suit-should-fit/), a casual weekend fit or even your sweaty gym gear  fit is absolute king.

Its already been invented  all you need to do is find the pieces that you like and put them together in a cohesive way that looks good on you. *The easiest way to do this is to stick to the classics.*\n\n[Steve McQueen](https://www.google.com/search?q=steve+mcqueen+style&safe=off&rlz=1C1CHWA_enIE609IE609&sxsrf=ALeKk00SDkBW83022VgG692HJSOBJ2xhdw:1585770383558&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjH0qCD_8foAhXioXEKHcoJBfcQ_AUoAXoECBEQAw&biw=1421&bih=637) was a master at this. Hes often lauded as one of the greatest ever style icons and features repeatedly year after year in article after article in mens style magazines and blogs. And his style still looks good today. Not bad for a dude whos been dead for 40 years.\n\nIf you look at how he dressed, theres nothing complicated about it  he just stuck to classic items like polo shirts, bomber and Harrington jackets, slim fit jeans, well fitting t-shirts and perfectly fitted suits.\n\nTheres nothing try-hard about his style, nothing fancy and nothing fashion, yet he looks cool, elegant and stylish  all the while combining classic items with perfect fit. He looks equally good in a suit, in motorcycle gear or even dressed head to toe in denim. That man knew how to dress. If youre looking for a style icon to [follow](https://www.thegentlemansjournal.com/style-icon-dress-like-steve-mcqueen/), you cant go far wrong with McQueen.\n\n \n\n# Keep it Simple\n\n*Its not complicated, so dont over complicate it.*\n\nClassic items will help you keep it simple but there are other areas where you need to stick to the basics:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***Colour.***\n\nYour colour friends are  [neutrals and earthy colours](https://www.shutterstock.com/image-vector/minimalistic-color-palette-chart-vector-573720589)  black, white, navy, grey, khaki, olive, beige and brown.\n\nThats it. Stick to a basic pallete.

If you look in your wardrobe, I guarantee that you wear 20% of your clothes 80% of the time. That is why you dont need a massive amount of clothes. You need a [small amount of clothes](http://theessentialman.com/how-to-create-minimalist-wardrobe/) that you will get a lot of wear out of.\n\n*You dont need lots of choices; you just need the right choices.*\n\nSo learn to choose carefully  or time after time, youll be left standing in front of a wardrobe full of clothes, frustrated that you have nothing to wear. Like a bitch.\n\n# Steal from Your Icons\n\n*One pretends to do something, or copy someone or some teacher, until it can be done confidently and easily in what becomes ones own style.*\n\n** Cary Grant**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you look at any famous creative people  musicians, artists, designers, film makers  none of them are original. They have all stolen from other artists, then learned how to tweak what they liked, combined it with other bits and made it their own. A great artist is basically a magpie.\n\nDeveloping your own style is no different. So find your style icons and rip them off. Yep.. just copy them.

Well, the answer is easy  for 100 bucks, you get quality in terms of design, materials and fit that will last. For 12 bucks, you get a [poorly fitting polo](https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Essentials-Slim-Fit-Lavendar-XX-Large/dp/B07N4P9DS6/ref=sr_1_8?dchild=1&keywords=polo+shirt&qid=1585770945&sr=8-8) made from low grade materials that looks like it cost 12 bucks and - after a few washes - is worthless. One well selected costly item has much more value than ten cheap ones. Not only in how it looks but in how much bang per buck it gives you.\n\nThe difference is even greater when youre buying [outerwear](https://www.reiss.com/ie/p/suede-zip-through-jacket-mens-marlo-in-tobacco-brown/?category_id=10396&gaEeList=M%20-%20Coats%20%26%20Jackets%20-%20Leather) and [footwear](https://www.johnvarvatos.com/amsterdam-chelsea-boot/190802674933.html#start=1).

Theres a reason why you pay more for leather, wool and cotton - its practically impossible to look good in man made synthetic materials like polyester, pleather and acrylic.\n\nIf you cant afford high quality clothes, there are numerous places and ways to get discounted quality clothing and footwear.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Shop online**\n\nA retailers job is to sell you shit you dont need  good retailers do this by maximising lighting and mirrors to make you look as good as possible when youre in the changing room. Ever tried on something in a shop, thought it looked good and when you got home realised that it looked better on in the shop? Thats why.\n\nYoure also a lot more likely to impulse buy. 3 shirts for 20 bucks on the sale rack? What a bargain. Thats 20 bucks for three shitty shirts thatll end up gathering dust in your wardrobe before you fuck them into the thrash. Yeah, real bargain.\n\nSo shop online use retailers that offer free deliveries and returns, then try on that shit in the comfort of your own home. This also allows you to try stuff on with things you already own. Theres no point in buying something that just doesnt fit into your wardrobe  youll never wear it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Never Go Full Retail**\n\nAll designers and high street shops are over-priced. Their pricing structures allow for their clothing to be sold at discount prices during sales periods and *still make a profit,* so dont pay full whack  wait for the sales, use discount codes, install the Honey add-on to your browser, sign up to newsletters for discounts, use cash back sites.\n\nOther places such as [Yoox](https://www.yoox.com/ie/men) offer designer clothes at discount prices. Youd be a fool to go full retail.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***Looking good isnt self-importance; its self-respect.***\n\n** Charles Hix**",

            "body": "The Dual Mating Strategies of Men and WomenAlpha Fucks and Beta Bucks is a well documented phenomenon in the Red Pill. Its the so called dual mating strategy that describes a womans instinct to seek sexual opportunities from the alpha (Alpha Fucks) and provisioning opportunities from the beta (Beta Bucks.) It seems generally assumed in the sphere that this strategy is exclusive to women, so this will be my brief attempt to show that a dual mating strategy is also present in men.\n\nAcross the sphere we see RP men constantly admitting their dual mating strategies. We want to fuck hoes, and marry virgins (low n-counts.) We want a lady in the streets, and a freak in the sheets. Men seek sexual opportunities from the whores, and provisioning opportunities from the virgins. Sigmund Freud expressed this dual mating strategy in his Madonna/Whore Complex: the tendency in men to view any particular woman as either a Madonna or a Whore. Madonnas (dont think of the superstar by this same name, it will confuse you) are women we perceive as pure, submissive, obedient, and faithful. Whores are women we perceive as sluts, large n-count, tattoo-ridden, disobedient, and unfaithful. History is full of men who were in love with their Madonna wives, only to cheat on them with a Whore. In fact many RP players have made careers out of fucking hoes only to eventually marry a woman they perceive as a Madonna. We all carry this Madonna/Whore instinct inside of us, and its quite clearly a dual-mating strategy, if we care to admit it.\n\nThis dual-mating strategy for both men and women may be a result of pre, and post, Agricultural Revolution societies. The findings of evolutionary psychology suggest that before the Agricultural Revolution sex in humanity was far more polygamous, liberal and free. People tended to sleep around for various reasons without taboo or stigma. Theres a lot in our biology that is evidence of this. This doesnt mean a womans hypergamy wasnt in effect, it just means being a hoe wasnt looked down upon. If this is true its safe to assume that women were hoes for a very long period of time. And this would explain our natural attraction to hoes. Further, pre-Agricultural Revolution, there was no such thing as property, assets, and marriage.\n\nPost-agricultural revolution introduced property, assets, and marriage, and this changed sexual relationships forever. People began to think heavily about guarantying their property and resources was passed on to their progeny. Men became interested in women who could guarantee this bequeathment, and women became interested in men who would share their resources. Suddenly virgins and beta men became more attractive. The forces of this new social pressure conditioned women to look for men who could provide provisioning (betas), and those same forces conditioned men to seek women who could be trusted with their resources (Madonnas.) Virgins can be trusted with property and assets more than whores, and beta men can be relied upon to share their resources more than alphas. In this hypothesis, a dual-mating strategy evolved in both men and women out of our ancient past of free and unbridled sex (pre-Agricultural Revolution) and the relatively recent development of commitment sex (post-Agricultural Revolution.)\n\nIn the RP theres this idea that you must maintain alpha-ness in your relationships at the expense of beta-ness, so that your wife doesnt cuck or leave you. While theres obvious truth to this, we should condition this view against our own dual mating strategy. In the life of a man, a virgin is perceived to be a prize. Sure, nothing turns us on more than a whore, and some married men will fuck them given the opportunity, but many wont. Many married men will stay faithful to their Madonna, even though she doesnt turn them on like a Whore. Understood in this way, we can see that while women may be attracted to Alphas, for them the prize might very well be a Beta. This is why we teach comfort tests. And while some women in relationships will still fuck the Alphas, many of them wont, and will stay faithful to their Beta. AF/BB is not a black and white line, its just an evolved tendency in women, just like the Madonna/Whore complex is an evolved tendency in men. But neither of these tendencies dictate with any certainty how a particular man or woman will act. This is not an excuse for a man to be a little bitch, a real RP man knows how to be both Alpha and Beta.\n\nI admit that the theory of AF/BB and Madonna/Whore instincts evolving out of a pre, and post, Agricultural Revolution society might simply be conjecture. But, the evidence that men have a dual mating strategy (like women) is overwhelmingly evident and universal.",

Pre-ag revolution most females procreated yet the majority of men did not.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\"Betas\" have **never** been the prize for women.  They've **always** been who they settle for after they've had their fun with the alphas and couldn't lock one down, or who they've used to extract resources in exchange for trickle sex.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAnd for the record I hate using the Alpha/Beta terms as bucket words, but for the autists in here it's just simpler that way.",

            "body": "Own Your Shit Weekly - April 21, 2020A fundamental core principle here is that you are the judge of yourself. This means that you have to be a very tough judge, look at those areas you never want to look at, understand your weaknesses, accept them, and then plan to overcome them. Bravery is facing these challenges, and overcoming the challenges is the source of your strength. \n\nWe have to do this evaluation all the time to improve as men. In this thread we welcome everyone to disclose a weakness they have discovered about themselves that they are working on. The idea is similar to some of the activities in No More Mr. Nice Guy. You are responsible for identifying your weakness or mistakes, and even better, start brainstorming about how to become stronger. Mistakes are the most powerful teachers, but only if we listen to them. \n\nThink of this as a boxing gym. If you found out in your last fight your legs were stiff, we encourage you to admit this is why you lost, and come back to the gym decided to train more to improve that. At the gym the others might suggest some drills to get your legs a bit looser or just give you a pat in the back. It does not matter that you lost the fight, what matters is that you are taking steps to become stronger. However, dont call the gym saying Hey, someone threw a jab at me, what do I do now?. We discourage reddit puppet play-by-play advice. Also, **don't blame others for your shit.** This thread is about you finding how to work on yourself more to achieve your goals by becoming stronger.\n\nFinally, a good way to reframe the shit to feel more motivated to overcome your shit is that after you explain it, rephrase it saying how you will take concrete measurable actions to conquer it. The difference between complaining about bad things, and committing to a concrete plan to overcome them is the difference between Beta and Alpha.\n\nGentlemen, Own Your Shit.",

Loving it so far; Im doing something every night with it.\n\n\\#60DoD\n\nWeek 4: Style\n\nLong before MRP, I was wearing old shoes and clothes. I just did not give a fuck. Right before I started on my journey, I figured out I needed basic, new shit. Anyways, Ive only touched on the surface, more than likely. I want to develop my own signature style, that screams grown and sexy.\n\nPlan: Re-assess my current wardrobe. Find and throw away anything with a hole in it or fading in color.\n\nBuy shirts, slacks, jeans, etc. that better align with my coming image of how I see myself. (Will be ongoing). Buy some more jewelry. Im a big fan of wrist wear, but only have a MVMT watch and a bracelet thats long overdue for replacing.\n\nDoD Snowball:\n\nWeek 1: Health and Fitness: Joined a gym. Bought a kettlebell. I do something daily.\n\nWeek 2: Nutrition: Counting calories. More ownership with what I eat.\n\nWeek 3: Hygiene, Hair, Cologne: Brushing 3x, flossing 1x, mouthwash 1x (minimum). Keeping body hair trimmed and neat.\n\nRead:\n\nTRM\n\nNMMNG\n\nReading:\n\nMAP  \nCant Hurt Me  \n'Bigger, Leaner, Stronger,  \nNMMNG (BF activities)\n\nCareer/Work:\n\nSticking to the plan. Studying, networking, and looking for/creating opportunities. I've broadened my thinking on this, however, and realized my goals here were quite superficial. I am looking into meaningful work that will satisfy me, and enable me to live the life I want to live. \n\nThis week:\n\n*Im shortening these up, so I may leave out a lot of detail. If anything catches your eye, just reply.*\n\nSo, I had a fight with wife. It was all my fault. I was frustrated about some shit she had said, and took it out on her the next day. Yes, passive aggressive and weak. Id like to focus on some takeaways from the experience:\n\n1. My wife pointed out that she had been going to bed early, because she knew that I would justpursue sex. (This is what she did) My takeaway: Im boring and predictable. I alsoforce the sexual experience instead of letting it unfold (as mentioned in NMMNG and TWOTSM).  \n2. (Next day) I told her that she could leave if she didnt want to participate as a family. She left and came back multiple times that day. Hysterical each time. I told her I wanted her gone, and to go take a walk for a few hours.My takeaway/actions: I acted like a bitch by giving her an ultimatum. What I mean by this is that I should not have to coax and threaten someone into doing something I want them to doespecially when it comes to participating in my family. My wife is showing me that I am not where I \\*thought\\* I was with my own mentality. She did threaten divorce, and I called her on her bluff. So, I may bengaf, but I still have a ways to go with frame.\n3. I have backed off. I had a covert contract with myself. Half covert contract, half pride and ownership. I was still looking for approval from mommy, and it was showing up in other areas.  \n\nI reset and have reevaluated wtf I was doing and how I was going about it.  I realize that, despite me getting stronger, trying to be more awesome and happy, etc. I was just, slowly, building a covert contract. I didnt have a complete meltdown and light the dynamite, but (almost)everything I was doing was for the wrong reasons despite my good intentions.\n\nAction Plan: Okay, so Im reading sidebar, Im lifting, and Im STFU. Im a whole lot better than I was when I started, but Im still a shithead faggot, eating paint.\n\n1. I am realizing I will fail at this shit, and thats okay. Whats important is to learn and keep pushing forward. I wanted to dump my whole marriage this passed weekend, but that wouldve been the easy way out. Keep pushing.  \n2. Learn from these experiences. As David Deida says, What is my woman trying to teach me here? What can I learn from the feminine? How can I find my more masculine source, (who the fuck I really am) through my life experiences with my woman, career, world, etc.?\n3. Lead myself first, please myself first. My needs come first.\n\n**Kids:**\n\nMy middle son is a mommys boy. My fault. I have not spent enough time with him, giving him the attention and love he deserves. This (probably) explains why he sucks his thumb, insists on sleeping next to mom, and defers to her authority. Ive backed off of using my forceful way of getting him to do what I want him to do. In a lot of ways, Ive used similar tactics with my wife, on him (ultimatums, threats, etc.)  well, the shit doesnt work.  \n\n\n**Further thoughts:**  \n\n\n>Further thoughts:I'm finding less and less 'shit' to own. ~~Maybe I'm not looking hard enough?~~\n\n**I wasnt. This hole Im in is deeper than I thought.**\n\nIm working on my mission now and getting back into my masculine by meditating and asking myself what I truly want from life, irrespective of family and expectations held by family members.\n\nIm digging deep and trying to get to the bottom of the question of Who am I.\n\nI see my woman as a representation of the feminine. As such, I have a lot to learn from her and learn about myself as I interact with her moods. I will dance with the feminine instead of seeking to control it.\n\nPain is Weakness leaving the body.

I have now cleaned my living space and am going to keep it organized and orderly, I let things pile up over the last few weeks while I've been prioritizing work and fucking around with girls \n\n###Mental\n\nIf I don't put me and my responsibilities first I will end up right back where I started, possibly in a worse place. It needs to be where I'm not chasing pussy, pussy is chasing me, and I give it the time of day on my terms and on my time, when my shit has actually been owned, and I have time to spare that I want to spend enjoying the company of a woman worth my time.\n\nThe external validation is like meth, extremely addictive, and it had been so long since I've felt a woman's interest, it was like being a first time user. In some ways I really am. On some level I knew all this, yet was weak over the last 2 weeks and indulged anyway. I'm coming down off of the validation binge now, and settling into what I said I needed to do last OYS: a more manageable amount of time spent on plating. I'll continue to step down my time commitment over the coming weeks, and continue working on identifying when I'm interacting for their validation (don't do it) and when I'm interacting for my own enjoyment and giving my time freely without expecting something back. \n\n###Family\n\nStill not spending as much time as I was here before plating, makes sense, you can only do one thing with your time at any given moment, I can't read 48LOP as a bedtime story to my 3yo, nor can I be at home with my kids if I'm out on a date, or at work, etc. \n\n###Financial\n\nSaving a lot. Stimulus came in, saving that too. \n\nBought some new clothes in prep for Style week of 60DoD, this should finish out the cycling of my wardrobe that I've done over the last 6 months, it will be piecemeal from now on, cleaning out old/stained things and replacing those with new ones. \n\n###Professional\n\nMy temporary assignment is nearly over, and the permanent promotions needed to free up that position for me haven't happened yet. They did extend me in this position though, another month. No matter what I'm in so much of a better position to take the next similar opening that its not even funny. I killed it over the last 3 months and everyone, I mean everyone, knows it. \n\n###Social\n\nBeen having fun on my dates. \n\nFucked Property Manager again, this time without the Nice Guy backdrop - I just did what I wanted, came, and that was that. Didn't worry about her at all. Spent a total of an hour at her place? Doesn't really matter. I wanted to fuck, so I did. \n\nDate 2 with Nurse is tomorrow. She said maybe at first, so I asked the next day \"is it a yes for you, or should I put that time back out on the market?\" Her \"Woooow, you are cut throat\" I said, my free time is valuable to me, we can hang out next week if it isn't good for you, just don't leave me in limbo. She said \"Got it\" and agreed to the date. We are doing a private Happy Hour at a secluded spot I picked out. \n\nDate 2 with Diver is a maybe, this one is a good learning opportunity for me, she's super assertive and independent, and I'm sometimes not sure how to respond because of it. She talked so much that I don't have to say much. We agreed to a plan, and when I texted to confirm the day before, she reneged but offered to reschedule to the next day. So I told her to come up with the idea, and once she had decided and suggested it I put a plan together to make it worth my time and fun for me and gave her a part in it. That plan she followed my lead and completed her assigned part quite well. Internally I focused on not reacting to her having so casually altered agreed on plans and staying positive and fun instead of getting offended like a faggot that she didn't do what I wanted when I wanted.\n\nDate 2 with Physical Therapist is a maybe. She's smart but kind of full of herself, maybe takes herself a little too seriously. \n\nDate 1 with Server who shit tested is later this week. \n\nOut of the 4 I like Nurse and Phys the best, they are the most fun to be with, but I'm keeping the pipeline moving. Lining up 4 more girls, but not taking so much time with any of them as I did the first batch. I'm learning.\n\n###Marriage\n\nSTBX was pissed back in February because I sent our tax refund to my personal account, then transferred her half when it came in. \"It should have gone to our joint account\" - and now with the stimulus it automatically went to my account again  so she was upset again. So I told her \"You threatened to take money that doesn't belong to you when you overreacted to me putting the savings back in savings at the end of last year. I've shared everything we've received 50/50. Maybe don't make threats next time, and I won't feel the need to protect myself.\" She tried to twist the facts, but I stood my ground, so she texted my mom a screengrab of our conversation . My mom told me she had and said I should be nicer... I told her to mind her own business. \n\nNothing else significant... finally found a place still doing Notary work and made an appointment this next week to get the uncontested document Notarized, STBX will be there to sign. \n\n###Goals\n\nDon't let on that I know about her indiscretions until after the divorce is final if necessary at all. (14 week streak)\n\nPlating OPSEC (2 week streak)\n\nGo to at least one Social activity without family. (3 week streak)\n\nApproach at least one HB that I'm attracted to for a random Day Bang Elderly Chat or other interaction. (9 week streak)",

Getting worried about mundane things is like when a small baby have a tantrum over a random toy.\n\nThe Mindful Attraction Plan (stalled)\n\nBook of pook (stalled)\n\nAudiobooks:\n\nTWOTSM  I followed HornsOfApathys advice and I am listening to audiobooks while training. Book is inspiring, too deep/god focused, maybe I am still not ready, but I am enjoying the explanations.\n\n**Myself:**\n\nConfinement. Routine. Wake up. Kids tasks. Cook. Work tasks. Food. Train or not. Projects or laziness in the evening. Rinse and repeat. Hey, I built a wall. No, not an emotional wall you feelings-porn-seeker, a real one with bricks and mortar. For being a first time I feel really proud. I build things. I am a man now.\n\nFor the DoD challenge, I keep working out, diet is not soo bad and of course I shower and shave every day you disgusting faggots! Keeping house a bit better, but I need to do some tasks none of my children (including wife) feel responsible for. They will. Because I will guide them.\n\nI have been busy with myself. Changes and habits take some time to settle, so I did not feel like writing weekly. It might sound like an excuse, but I did not want to repeat myself. Still, from time to time is good to write down to keep the pulse (and get some kick in the ass from wiser men).  \n\nI own that I need to improve with the kids. I could be better and schedule better and be stricter and plan better and guide better but they are kids and are trapped here, so I let them slip a bit from schedule and be kids. Still, there is room to improvement and I will go for it. A bit stricter in the mornings and more playful in the afternoons, that will be me.\n\nTime is scarce due to the fact that I am supposed to be working and dealing with kiddos at the same time, and this is not possible. So I work afternoons after wife comes back from the job.\n\nI am still searching for my mission. By listening TWOTSM I had to stop lifting for a few minutes and list all the shit I like to do, I want to do, and there are a lot of things, but no real legacy yet. Nothing tells me go for it, they are still a bunch of long-term things I want to do. I will choose some things and see if it brings me to a better sense of mission.  \n\n**Current goals:**\n\n* Reach 1000 lbs club: deadlifting heavy is the best feeling I have in life. I cannot explain it but if I had to do a personal record or fuck, I would go for deadlifting (iron oneitis?). Max 1RM theoretic calculations put me in 800. I will try when it says 1100.\n* Play guitar. And sing. I will be a rock star. Yeah I also dont believe it, but it is fucking fun.\n* Be consistent with my working, training, household, etc. I need to put it as a goal because being the best me is part of my mission.\n\n**Relationship:**\n\nI am surprised on how unemotional I have become regarding my relationship most of the time. No, really, not angry anymore, no fear or whatever. I was over-sensitized lately and jumping at every bone. I somehow dont care about many things that would have had me angry and emotional regarding the relationship. I kind of see shit tests and am sorry, what?, you expect me to react to that?. Old me would DEER and whine and justify and make things rational and explain and prove and try and on and on but new(TM?) me is kind of whatever IDNGAF. And the best is that I mean it. My relationship is still really important to me, but the explosions/situations of the moment are not interesting me at all.  \n\nToo much shit to do to be bothered I guess I am now at 80% of the time with this attitude, 20% resentment. This 80% is not rambo, it includes  initiating, relaxed attitude dude this confinement has been a blessing in disguise for me. The 20% are still my insecurities and fears and still being angry for not getting the treatment I deserve and fuck the noise, I just STFU and it disappears after some time. I am kind of relieved I am not in the emotional roller-coaster anymore.  \n\nWe are still not talking about us, but I am not sure I want to taaaaalk anymore. We share time together, play with the children, have some interesting non-relationship conversations, watch some serial together, pair of sexy times a week (I want more, and I dont get butthurt when rejected most of the time)... a standard blueish relationship. If she is fucking around or hiding things/lying is her fucking problem, fuck her (I still have oneitis, so I am trying to fake it until I make it). Not where I want to be, but far better than before. I take my time for myself and she is not the center of the universe, the center of the universe is again that marvelous land called Fraggle Rock or me, better me.  \n\n**Lifting:**\n\n\\#60DoD  Weights are improving. I was lying to myself in the first OYS about my weights, this is where I though I was. Well, I was not close, I injured myself because I was too proud to lower the weights and do proper form, recovered and now my lifts are where I really am, proper form and at a minimum x5. I am fine with that and getting in a good shape.  \n\nDoing Phraks Greyskull LP Variant and adding some shoulder and back exercises alternating days, plus some abs.  \n\nStill a bit of fat, but I look better in pictures than two months ago. I had not decided in my last OYS if reducing body fat or going for increasing strength. I will go for the strength, I felt miserable when I tried to cut calories. And the mirror shows me a better body now, so even at the same BF% there is a huge difference.\n\n**Diet & habits:**\n\nI feel better and more energetic when I eat in a surplus. I will not go go-mad, but will keep calories high for now.  \n\nI stopped cigarettes completely. They are disgusting now. Weed is reduced to evenings with wife, but I am also cutting that from last night (not even a goodbye joint, I stopped already). I dont drink, so I will go back to weed for recreational purposes, but I need at least a full clean month before considering that for now.  \n\nI have enough rest, but I am not sleeping my 8 hours. I need to schedule myself better now that I am really doing things.  \n\n**Financial:**\n\nWe share expenses. No change here. I started to do projects with the computer. Nothing that can create money yet, but the skills I need to build them will put me on the right track.\n\n**Social:**\n\nWith the virus outbreak I am isolated at home with the kids. That is making social interaction scarce. Some video calls at work and with groups of friends, but they are not the real thing.",

How would I be different if I knew the people I care about would never leave/stop loving me? \n\n* On an intellectual level yes but it doesnt feel that way. What else is there to love other than how I give to them and if I have imperfections then I am giving less. The bit about people being attracted to another persons life energy resonated with me, I used to have that but I seem to have lost it to a large degree. The work Im doing here is bringing it back. \n* I would say what I thought, I would express myself authentically, I would not consider how they would react before speaking. I wouldnt pass everything through the will it piss them off filter, I would not try and prove how useful I am, I would just act in line with my authentic self rather than towards getting a specific action from them. \n\n**Breaking Free Activity 8:** Validating behavior to stop/increase. \n\n* Im not in a relationship so that eliminated a lot of my normal validation seeking behavior. I picked seeking validation from women on apps as this is something I was working on anyway. I am cutting that out. \n* When I was doing it more, I felt distracted and like I was always chasing something. I was living outside myself and I felt pulled in all different directions.

I say these before bed during my 10min med. \n\n* I am lovable just as I am\n* My needs matter\n* I do not break\n* I am my own judge  \n* I am consistently improving myself and my life\n* I am deeply connected to all things in life\n* I let fear pass through me\n* I focus and apply myself towards my goals \n* I like and respect myself \n\n**Breaking Free Activity 11: Go on a retreat alone.** \n\nDuring lockdown this is not viable. Having said that, I regularly spend time alone, camping alone etc and this is some of the most stress free and enjoyable time for me. \n\n**Breaking Free Activity 12**: Do you believe its ok to have needs? Do you belief people want to help you meet your needs? Do you believe this world is a place of abundance? \n\n* No to all three questions. \n* I remember hiding myself away as a kid and feeling embarrassed of needing anything emotionally. At the same time, I dont want to become more needy. Im not sure how to balance these two, I need to understand how to be self-reliant and not needy but at the same time recognize and act on my needs. \n* Re people meeting your needs, Im not sure what I think, really at the end of the day it is an exchange of value. If they get what they want from you they will give in return. \n* I think fear is at the root of my scarcity. I close up to the world to protect myself and so the world is closed to me. When I was a kid, there was money scarcity, I was given messages that having nice things (like a nice car) was selfish, when I was a teen/early 20s there was women scarcity (and money scarcity!) and now I have a general scarcity attitude. I am starting to open up from this, seeing there are plenty of women, friends and opportunities in life. Im still not there on the money.",

            "body": "Own Your Shit Weekly - May 05, 2020A fundamental core principle here is that you are the judge of yourself. This means that you have to be a very tough judge, look at those areas you never want to look at, understand your weaknesses, accept them, and then plan to overcome them. Bravery is facing these challenges, and overcoming the challenges is the source of your strength. \n\nWe have to do this evaluation all the time to improve as men. In this thread we welcome everyone to disclose a weakness they have discovered about themselves that they are working on. The idea is similar to some of the activities in No More Mr. Nice Guy. You are responsible for identifying your weakness or mistakes, and even better, start brainstorming about how to become stronger. Mistakes are the most powerful teachers, but only if we listen to them. \n\nThink of this as a boxing gym. If you found out in your last fight your legs were stiff, we encourage you to admit this is why you lost, and come back to the gym decided to train more to improve that. At the gym the others might suggest some drills to get your legs a bit looser or just give you a pat in the back. It does not matter that you lost the fight, what matters is that you are taking steps to become stronger. However, dont call the gym saying Hey, someone threw a jab at me, what do I do now?. We discourage reddit puppet play-by-play advice. Also, **don't blame others for your shit.** This thread is about you finding how to work on yourself more to achieve your goals by becoming stronger.\n\nFinally, a good way to reframe the shit to feel more motivated to overcome your shit is that after you explain it, rephrase it saying how you will take concrete measurable actions to conquer it. The difference between complaining about bad things, and committing to a concrete plan to overcome them is the difference between Beta and Alpha.\n\nGentlemen, Own Your Shit.",

Sidebar.\n\n**Mission:**\n\nWin each day.\n\n**Physical:** *Be strong, fit, powerful and injury free into old age.*\n\n* Cardio times three (Hill sprints, run, metcon)  these are for mental health more than anything. \n* Weights three sessions\n* I go in energy cycles, for a few days Ill need less sleep, be more awake and I think have orgasms that dont feel as good, then Ill be more tired, sleep more, and my orgasms feel betternot sure what the fuck that means. \n\n**Separation:**\n\nEx is using daughter as bargaining chip. The mediation process has been surprisingly unbiased after I got rid of the first mediator. I have only done the intake session and Im sure they try and make you feel heard so Ill wait until we actually sit down to make a call. Im doing what needs to be done. If we go to court, I am ready but I suspect this is stressing me out more than I realize (see mood in mental). \n\n*Guilt*: this is still a major problem for me. My ex has stopped my overnights for no reason and I still feel guilty only paying the mandated child support. Even the mediator asked if I had considered only paying what Im legally required to pay. There are benefits to paying more, but I can't separate how much is guilt and how much is the benefits. \n\n**Mental/Mindset:** *Express myself authentically.*\n\nI am trying to focus on just doing what I want. Not putting it through any filters (society or MRP) just what I want. I still need to be very careful with all the covert contracts etc but Im trying to act more authentically and noticing when the shit comes up so I can more quickly move into that space. \n\n*Mood*: Lower than it has been over the past few weeks. I still have periods of joy but mostly when with my daughter. Feeling more emotional I feel like crying for no reason, watched something sad in a movie, felt like crying... Still mood is better than before the T-Cream. I have been deliberately digging into painful memories/thought patterns and maybe that plus the worry about the STI and ex being a shit with court is wearing on me. Im not entirely sure. \n\nWhen feeling flat Im focusing on letting go of shoulds e.g. I should be driven and crushing life and instead just taking the next manageable step. This is helping keep me more productive on these days. E.g. one day I was feeling a bit lazy and annoyed at myself, I should be driven and motivated at all times. But thats bullshit and just uses mental energy on negative thought loops, instead I checked off the productive things I had already done; work, got blood taken, ate healthy and then I went and meditated for 20min and did hill sprints. Consistent forward progress. I will apply my mental energy to this rather than chastising myself for failing. \n\n*Anger*: I have a lot of it, Im pissed at what happened to my dad, pissed at what happened to me and pissed at my ex. I am struggling to manage my anger at my ex. She is driving us towards court for ridiculous reasons and wont get what she wants out of it. I am praying in the iron temple and upping the cardio, channeling my anger there is helping. Also, Im trying to change the narrative, when I find myself running a skit in my head I replace it with, you have all the big wins already and you are just going to keep building a great life. What do you want right now? \n\n*Needs*: something that resonated from NMMNG was having needs means being needy and needy represents a one-way ticket to abandonment. I am really starting to see how having emotions was met by a parent shutting down and how this is driving a lot of my current dysfunctional relationship patterns. \n\n*Caretaking*: this runs so deep, I see myself as the protector from life. I dont know what I have to offer apart from this. I feel like women wouldnt want me unless I provide this. Interestingly the thing thats helping the most is time alone in nature, I feel my life energy I just exist and thats when I feel most whole. Women can want this or not its up to them. But on some level I know its more attractive. Still, new mental models take a while to embed and this is a deep one for me.\n\n*Goals*: last week u/[Blarg\\_Risen](https://www.reddit.com/user/Blarg_Risen)  pointed out I need goals. I still need to do some work in this space but I wrote down my values/who I want to be, my 3 month objectives and longer term goals. I read this regularly and am finding it is helping me stay focused. \n\n**Parenting:** *Provide an environment for my daughter that gives her the opportunity to grow into a happy, healthy and capable person.*\n\nI am present and calm with daughter, I enforce boundaries but give her as much space to experiment with life as I can. Im happy with this area. Current focus areas are: be present, calm, clear boundaries, enabling independent play and not letting my stress with ex leak over into our interactions.",

Worst is giving up bacon and going back to oatmeal for breakfast. I've acquired shoulder pain from having to substitute barbells for dumbbells in OHP. I had moved to dumbbells due to an unrepaired shoulder separation 35 years ago. Barbell use these past few weeks has been challenging - my shoulders are not happy.\n\n**Mindset**\n\nAfter working thru PON and using it successfully for a few weeks I grew complacent about my mental state. I still had various \"victim\" flare ups but was dealing with them pretty consistently. But Thursday night I had a real rage attack. I had gone to bed early, wife slipped in quietly later. Some how this triggered some flashback and I was filled with anger. Didn't say or do anything, just got up and went to another room to sleep. The next morning I tried to reset, and seemed to get control but by evening it was back again. Wife tried to initiate, and apologized without knowing what the problem was. It seemed like all my work focusing on Now wasn't really resolving anything but just hiding it. A lot of repressed anger there, Mr. Banner. Had to go back to square one on this one. It may be due to this being the first time in years that I've been home for this long.\n\n**Relationship**\n\nWife was concerned but there isn't anything she can do. My internal mental issues are another opportunity to STFU. I had been doing ok with constant daytime banter and \"gaming\", but had to restart and rebuild after my incident.

I have at least a year and half or more remaining (at my current take home pay + side income) for debt payoff.Stick with my plan. Any extra income goes into paying off debt. More importantly, do not accumulate more debt.  \n2. Prep. Ive begun mentally planning for saving for a down payment for a house. According to DR, I should be paying off debt first, but Ive heard otherwise, from other reliable sources. Either way, Id like to be rid of credit card debt, first.  \n3. Budget. As with a lot of my problems, making a plan and sticking to it is my weakness. The problem right now is not overspending, its not controlling and managing where and to what my money goes.  \n4. Control. Self-control is key. My wife is on an allowance and I should also put myself on an allowance to be honest, in order to more effectively tackle my debt and save.  \n\n\nWeek 1: Health and Fitness: Joined a gym. Bought a kettlebell. I do something daily. Week 2: Nutrition: Counting calories. More ownership with what I eat.  \nWeek 3: Hygiene, Hair, Etc.

Still have yet to purchase a book on game, but have been following PoNs advice on game. Need to game randos.  \n\n\n**Read:**TRM, NMMNG, MAP  \n**Reading:** Cant Hurt Me, 'Bigger, Leaner, Stronger,NMMNG (BF activities), Atomic Habits  \n\n\n**Career/Work:**  \n*From last week:Asking myself how my work/career can contribute to my mission. How can I position myself to come out ahead after the dust settles with this Covid-19 situation? What do I want to do? Where do I see myself in x years?*  \n\n\nI have an idea of where and how I want to live. How can/should I plan my career around this?  \nI want my career to supplement my lifestyle, not the other way around. I.E. I have to live in the city, because thats where my office is AND commuting team is more bearable.  \nId rather live in a location and house that I love, and have a job/business that compliments/works well with that.  \n\n\n**This week:**\n\nIve been enjoying the time off doing necessary stuff around my apartment, getting ready for the upcoming summer. Prepping kids to sleep in their own room, study, and just going through the motions. It all feels like one big blur. I cant remember what the fuck I did last week. I havent been writing in my journal as I should. Im still a lazy faggot.  \n\n\nI did fuck up my work out routine this past week, as it was my wifes birthday. I slept in, ate shit, and didnt work out as I shouldvebummer. I have very little discipline, still. My nutrition plan is okay at best, but I make too many exceptions in other areas. Ive realized that I dont have the self-control or discipline it takes, yet, to cut loose a little bit, then be back on the grind the next moment.  \n\n\nSo I really need to create environments, according to Atomic Habits, where I set myself up for success. Id love to hear from you guys on how you dealt with a lack of discipline or built more self-control.  \n*Kids:*   \nOne area I am constantly failing in, is patience with my son. I love my boy, and I understand that if I dont unfuck myself I could inadvertently create a Nice Guy who hates his father. This upcoming off-period, I am going to actively focus on being patient and better with him.  \n\n\n**Further thoughts:**  \nDiscipline. Self-Control. Priorities.  \n\n\n**Pain is Weakness leaving the body. Onward.**",

            "body": "I think I might have just accidentally swallowed the wrong pill.This is a WALL. But getting this off my chest feels good so I'm gonna leave it that way.\n\nTLDR I'm respected more for not placating my common law wife. How can I do sweet romantic things that she lives for and not get re-wrapped up in a cycle of false compromise?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo just a funny story. Been going through some stuff lately with all this extra face time with my partner. For the last 11 years we have been in a battle of wits because ever since taking a few classes on human sexuality in college I came to the conclusion that \"I don't want to have sex with just one person for the rest of my life\" and ever since we have just been at odds, every argument devolving into \"well if you just want other women then go\" and I would swallow my pride and try and make things up as best I could. Don't really regret any of this but in retrospect I was just hurting myself my not just \"doing what I want\" and letting the chips fall where they may. I stifled my education, felt no motivation to acquire wealth or solidify friendships. It all kept coming back to this futility between what I want and what I am \"supposed\" to want. All I wanted was to do this in the \"best\" way for both of us, wanted to be as honest as possible, and wanted to ultimately fill our life with love and social connection. She wouldn't even accept that I wanted those things, It had to be about her vulnerability in life, and everything I was saying/doing was just a means to get away and marry some other girl.... And my play was to waste my entire 20's on this?!?\n\nFast forward to the vids-19 and I simply couldn't keep pretending like this wasn't ruining my life. Basically a \"I love you, but I now realize that if I don't do this for myself then I won't respect myself as a man, or even as a father, and I don't want to bring crippled life into this world.\" Didn't even have to say \"I'm going do it or I'm going to leave\" or any truly shitty ultimatum, just simply \"I am going to be doing this, and I respect you're decision to do what you will with that information.\n\nBoom. Instant \"I want you to be happy, I know you really care about me etc. etc. etc. we can make this work.\"\n\nWhere was this the last 10 years when I was trying to compromise and do things without being a dick? Why is this here now?\n\nSo off we go, she tells me \"I'd like to be a part of this journey with you, if you're patient with me I WANT to come along.\" Go on a dating app for ethical non mono's, find a beautiful woman (whose partner wasn't a total goob) who was keenly interested in dating. All lights are green, I'm communicating with both of them and we are jiving well, I'm feeling... Good.\n\nI start exercising more, cut crap out of my diet. It was easy! I had reason! I WANTED to be attractive again. And it felt... Great. Like a literal cloud had lifted from my vision and I could taste the vigor and optimism I had in my early 20s before it was chipped away. I started answering calls, I \"forgot\" to smoke weed from sunrise to sunset. So many things in life just started falling back into place.\n\nWhen the time comes and we start a group text, everyone is talking and jiving, but I realize that my partner has only said one thing, and it's starting to feel awkward all around. When I ask her if she is having a hard time opening up, or if there is a reason she doesn't feel comfortable participating in the conversation she says... her fingers hurt too much....\n\nYour fingers hurt?!?!? I excuse myself for a moment to try and smooth over my bubbling anger and take the time to think of the words to express my frustration, less than 3 or 4 minutes literally just took a piss. I come back and she is sleeping on the couch.\n\nI become livid, absolutely livid (I have also been having to deal with the unemployment office on a daily basis which is incompetent as hell so my patience as a whole is way less than usual.) I tell myself I am going to have a glass of wine... literally black out after the first few sips and wake up with half a 6 pack and a pack of cigarettes with 4 missing. I was devastated, I had worked so hard to quit smoking, and had gotten my drinking under control years ago and I allowed myself to be crushed by petty squabble.\n\nLong story short every micro step of the way she was sabotaging me, changing the rules of engagement. Generally running diversion as a means of delaying the inevitable.\n\nFast forward to today. In general we do our best to keep our good time \"good.\" So we decide to pack a lunch and take a short 5 or so mile hike through the woods and have great conversation about our family, life goals, what we would want for our children. Just general good stuff that you look for in a good relationship. Get home, and try and tactfully inquire about some sexy time. She says something along the lines of \"its hard for me to feel sexy when your talking to other women.\" so I take that for what it is, wait a while and eventually just rub one out. Not a huge deal, I've been taking care of myself for years now.\n\nSome time later she comes up as I'm working on some Spanish lessons, asks me if I emailed her the recipe for this pizza dough I've been working on for the last 3 weeks (she knows I already did, she had it pulled up on her phone and I could see it!) I tell her that I'm pretty sure it's in her hand right now, she asks if I want to help her make it... Nah not what I'm \"wanting\" right now. She tells me she doesn't know how to use the kitchen scale... So I go and show her and carry on about my day.\n\nComes back up as I'm finishing my last lesson and asks, again, if I \"want\" to go pick up some cheese from the store for her... You know what, sure, I could use the air and stroll and I do love you after all.\n\nI pop into the store, and grab 2 things instinctively. The cheese, and her favorite flowers.\n\nAs I'm walking back up the driveway the heavy shit hits... If I'm buying her these flowers because I want sex I'm just fucking myself over. I'm literally rewarding her for playing hard to get and trying to stifle my upward momentum. And out of my mouth with glee, almost as if they weren't my own words I say. \"Theses are my flowers!\"\n\nI come in hand her the cheese with flowers in hand. She is beaming, eyes welling up. \"Why did you get me flowers?\" I tell her I didn't, and that I got them because I just wanted them. I ask her, \"where do we keep the vases again?\" Plop that vase right in my officer and carry on with my day.\n\nShe literally won't stop BEGGING to give me sexual attention. But I'm good just wanked!\n\nThis is CRAZY. But it doesn't feel anymore crazy than what I was doing before placating her every-move.\n\nAny tips to not ride this train off a cliff? I feel like I can still feel this way, and be sweet and loving and romantic, but right now I'm getting more positive attention being an asshole. I never wanted to believe that the whole \"assholes\" get girls thing was even real in any sense. Can I just like convey this to her somehow or am I best off maxing out on this new found mentality. Yeeehaw!",

            "body": "Own Your Shit Weekly - May 12, 2020A fundamental core principle here is that you are the judge of yourself. This means that you have to be a very tough judge, look at those areas you never want to look at, understand your weaknesses, accept them, and then plan to overcome them. Bravery is facing these challenges, and overcoming the challenges is the source of your strength. \n\nWe have to do this evaluation all the time to improve as men. In this thread we welcome everyone to disclose a weakness they have discovered about themselves that they are working on. The idea is similar to some of the activities in No More Mr. Nice Guy. You are responsible for identifying your weakness or mistakes, and even better, start brainstorming about how to become stronger. Mistakes are the most powerful teachers, but only if we listen to them. \n\nThink of this as a boxing gym. If you found out in your last fight your legs were stiff, we encourage you to admit this is why you lost, and come back to the gym decided to train more to improve that. At the gym the others might suggest some drills to get your legs a bit looser or just give you a pat in the back. It does not matter that you lost the fight, what matters is that you are taking steps to become stronger. However, dont call the gym saying Hey, someone threw a jab at me, what do I do now?. We discourage reddit puppet play-by-play advice. Also, **don't blame others for your shit.** This thread is about you finding how to work on yourself more to achieve your goals by becoming stronger.\n\nFinally, a good way to reframe the shit to feel more motivated to overcome your shit is that after you explain it, rephrase it saying how you will take concrete measurable actions to conquer it. The difference between complaining about bad things, and committing to a concrete plan to overcome them is the difference between Beta and Alpha.\n\nGentlemen, Own Your Shit.",

It was recommended by more experienced guys. I couldn't see it at the time but I was clinging to MRP like a life buoy.\n\n**Mindset:**\n\nI am confident that the work that I am doing is compounding. I can see how I celebrate too early. Instead I will use those times to recalibrate. There is some learned helplessness masked by distractions that I need to deal with.\n\n# MAP\n\n**Physical:**\n\nThe home workouts are going well. I will work faster at the gym when it reopens. I will use current frustration to fuel more workouts.\n\n**Money and Material Wealth:**\n\nThe work I was doing before the pandemic is steady. It is more demanding. I will systemise more and dedicate the time to new opportunities. That is what I am going to focus on for the rest of the month of May.\n\nMy best cash ooportunity is via my creativity. I will set up sales channels for this with the time gained from routinisation.\n\nI am a maker. I can make and manage production teams. The review and reorientation process is my least favorite. This because it doesnt feel like making. This effects my earnings and options. I need to incorporate improvement in these phases into my money and management systems.\n\n**Comfort:**\n\nThe comfort I gave myself recently is a few drinks at the weekend. What I am masking is dissatisfaction. I have cut out the weekend drinking to force myself to define what I want more specifically.\n\nThere is resentment in the lack of looking after myself first. Previously I have either over battled or bailed. Again the need for calibration raises it head.\n\nHOA made a comment to the effect You cant create for someone what you havent created for yourself. Well...you can. But it is not good. Weve a saying where Im from, The cobblers children go barefoot. Enough of this.\n\nTo be congruent you have to build your frame for yourself, not on the promise of favorable outcomes. \n\n\n**DHV:**\n\nI was advising on National projects for my countrys response to Covid-19 this coupled with my busy work life, home workout and OYSing has taken on an extra positive halo during the 'crisis'. As the kids say, Im glowed up. But its because of the theatre lights.\n\nThis adds to dread. Her compliance is increasing and harpiness is decreasing. The current situation is demonstrating to my family and network that I prepared for this type of work reshuffle for years.\n\nThis is resulting in more efforts to keep me and some shitty comfort tests. I have reread some of J10's posts on Shitty Comfort Tests and managed them accordingly. \n\nI have some residual resentment about AWALT. I will channel this in lifting. And into reflecting on my personality and preferences.\n\nIn addition I have been coasting in the sunlight that comes from not being an autist during a pandemic. \n\nIt's time to up my game and take advantage of the free roll Covid has given many of us.\n\n\n**Personality and Preference:**\n\nThis is emerging more. I am making the space to express my preferences by better planning and taking the time to reflect. \n\n**Sex:**\n\nThe sex is always there. I get it when I want it. It's enthusiastic. I'm not here for that anymore. \n\nThere are things I would like to try in bed but it's not a priority. More precisely, its note a priority with my wife in her current body shape. Her tits look great and BJ performance has improved through more nuance and demonstrable hunger. \n\nThe only game i am running is asshole game combined with push/pull and healthy doses of stfu. It works fine at the moment. I could add kino. \n\nOneitis is dead but willingness to Nuke the Nuclear Family isnt in play yet. I could do it but would I? \n\nEarly in this process I would have said yes, but anger would have been the fuel. I may say 'yes' again soon and improved preparedness will be the gate to that transition.",

Classic ego-driven, I don't need this shit, it's dragging me down thinking. I'm incapable of holding myself to account at this point, even without you guys 'dragging me down' and I can see I'm a few weeks from never posting again so it's time to get back at it before it's too late.\n\nI'm vaping and drinking more than ever. I'm being a total weak-ass shit about this. It's bugging me endlessly and I can't seem to find the will to make a serious effort just for me. Why bother with anything if I can't do the real basic shit? I won't drink this week (with a target of at least four weeks) and I will stop vaping as soon as I post this. It's a shame I can only do it to please a bunch of strangers on the internet, but it worked last time and I won't go back again. Pathetic whichever way you look at it but I'll take it.\n\nThese failures lead easily to lots of thinking about what I want in life, what my purpose and mission is, am I simply content to be billy beta and the plough horse. Despite what I might think consciously, deep down I don't think I believe in myself or that I have value or I can do better or deserve it.\n\nI do have the power to change that and my 'pleasure' seeking and self-sabotaging ways but it's going to take a long time, I ain't no Horns. I'll use the reality this place presents, as unpleasant as it can be, as best I can.\n\nLock-down is working in my favour and will for a couple more months. I'm saving lots of time and money, my weight is down a couple of Kg, I'm almost hitting 50% protein, I'm eating almost no junk.\n\nPhysically I feel like shit and exercise is a struggle. I'm weak and the causes are clear because it isn't sleep or diet. I finally really, really accepted I'm skinny fat, hence the good work on the diet. Ditto on being weak, first steps there are the vaping and drinking and simply not having a day off from doing something and sucking up the soreness.\n\nRelationships are good, surprisingly so considering lockdown, but I won't fool myself I still don't have a ton of work to do, especially when it comes to application rather than knowledge.",

Im still driven by wanting to change myself, which considering what Im like is probably a good thing for now.\n\n*Mood*  still low mood more than I would like, I had about two weeks where I was feeling good, I am still consistently feeling much better than I was and I think this will improve. Today I was feeling bad and thinking about how I would post it here and someone would save me, somehow make it better. Then I just let myself feel bad, I didnt have to do anything with that emotion. I felt immediate much better and free, I still dont feel great today but that letting go of needing to fix it and of the caretaking was a big improvement. Links into below:\n\n*Feelings covert contract*  last week u/Blarg_Risen pointed out that Im not depressed but that I have (among other things) a covert contract around feeling sad. I have been thinking a lot about this and was playing out a skit in my head when I saw just how deep the covert contract is:\n\nI was at my Dads grave and was sad\n\n* My partner (who I dont even have in real life) in this skit came up and hugged me/supported me  took care of me\n* I realized the emotion I was imagining was more about eliciting a care response from her than actual sadness and I realized how far I have come from freely expressing myself. I need others validation for my emotions so much more deeply than I thought.\n* Then I thought about expressing my sadness without trying to elicit a response from anybody and that felt freeing.\n* Then I got to the bit Im struggling with, I want to be able to express my authentic emotions around others and I do want them to hear them in an appropriate way (e.g. not laugh) and to connect over this. Im not sure how I get to this point, is it somewhere I can get to?\n\n*Point of origin*  Im still trying to be happy by making life good rather than me good. Every now and again I feel like my life can be whatever I make it and that feels awesome. This can very easily turn to the Shame ->overwhelm cycle below.\n\nI have a strong through pattern of me not meeting my own expectations -> shame -> overwhelm -> give up/seek caretaking. Comparing myself to others very often triggers this.\n\nIm slowly starting to see emotions are independent of any reactions to the issue. E.g. I was having some emotion about my dad (missing him) then I thought I should do what would make him proud this is the first time (I think) that I have caught myself in this. I realized that my missing him was completely separate to my actions and that I want to make myself proud, separate to that, I miss him.\n\nI still want someone to love me, Im still scared of being alone, I dont think Ill be ok with bad emotions etc.\n\n**Misc.**\n\nCurrently Im living at my moms house, the lawyer has advised I stay here until custody is settled as it gives us several advantages and preempts any false accusations from ex. The house is on a corner and basically subdivided with an entry on each street, if I did a few things it would be subdivided. I am considering staying in the other house for 1-2 years after the custody is sorted as it would be good for my daughter and save me time and money (I would still pay rent but cheaper than I could get something equivalent for), if I rented something else I would have to move to a cheaper area and it would be further away from daughters childcare/ex etc. Objectively living there would help me move towards my goals but Im feeling resistance toward it. Im currently reading the monogamous to your mom chapter of NMMNG and I dont think its that as she doesnt try and leech any emotions, doesnt over step boundaries and just generally that chapter didnt resonate with me either time I read it (defense mechanism?). I think its because I imagine bringing girls back and Im living next door to my mom but why do I give a shit what they think? If I was advising a friend I would say, live there, make progress towards your goals and when you have achieved xyz (I have some specific ones in mind) then you will have the money to afford a place where you want. Who gives a shit what other people think, but Im not advising a friend and I cant separate the issues in my head here.",

Ray Dalio said pain + reflection = growth. Friends in high school, trial, etc. Many things I can think of. \n\nNow: Ex shitiness, this is an opportunity for me to practice and grow so I can become the man I want to be and have what I want in my life.  \n\n**Breaking Free Activity 19:** One area where you routinely feel frustrated or out of control. Are you trying to project the reality you want onto the situation? If you had to accept the reality of this situation, how might you change your response to it?\n\nRelationships/women  I want the bluepill fantasy, I want to life happily ever after, I want there to be something more than survival of the fittest. If I had to accept this, which Im currently trying to do, I would treat online dating as marketing, I would accept I wont be loved like that but that I dont need to be and accept there is no relationships destination where I can relax and just be me. \n\nSeparation  Im still having a hard time accepting this, it ties into the above, Im holding onto the blue pill fantasy and ignoring reality. The reality is, she did thinks regularly that crossed my boundaries, I let her from the start and doesnt offer that much in a relationship. If I accepted all this then I would let go and move on, acknowledge my tendency to only remember the good and remind myself of the bad, accept that I might have been able to make it work had I been less of a faggot but its too late now. \n\nLife  I want there to be a meaning to life but I know there is only the meaning you make. It feels pointless that we just life to reproduce and die, I want there to be something more. If I accepted this I would do more of what I want, for me, not some false obligation to society or anybody else. I would care less what they thought of me, angry selfish, whatever the accusations, I would just life for me and what I want. \n\nDaughter  I have fear that Ill lose her somehow, death, ex stopping my access etc. And I might. If I accepted this I would have less anxiety. \n\n**Breaking Free Activity 20**  guidelines for feelings. \n\nRead, try to keep in mind. \n\nSome comments, feelings are separate to the issue, I make them one and the same, you can have a feeling with no obligation to do anything and without it meaning anything. I am scared to have feelings, I am scared of having bad feelings that I cant handle and just any feelings but by stopping them I actually feel much worse. I am not even able to feel safe in my own feelings, how is a woman supposed to be safe in me?  \n\n**Breaking Free Activity 21**  list one fear that has been controlling your life. Use affirmations I can handle it, no matter what happens, I will handle it until you take actions and stop feeling fear. \n\n* Moving on form the separation. \n* My daughter dying. \n* Starting a business.\n\n**Breaking Free Activity 22**  Identify one area that is out of integrity. Identify the fear. \n\nTruly moving on from ex, I would fantasize about her sexually and indulge fantasys of us getting back together. I would use this to avoid feeling negative feelings about the relationship and family breaking down. I am scared I am making a mistake, that my daughter will suffer as a results, that Ill regret my decision, that I will be alone and not able to have what I want. I think this is being driven by; I dont back myself and I fear exs actions. I still dont have the confidence that I can make my life whatever I want (although I get glimpses of it). \n\nFear 2: I fear starting/taking on something big. I am scared it will overwhelm me and Ill quit. That I will fail and be laughed at. As a kid, my family went bankrupt due to a business venture and I think I associate that to trying something myself. Considering my current situation, I think the best plan is to spend a few more months getting my shit sorted and starting something on the side. From there I can reassess.",

It has been money well-spent. Having an \"official program\" that spells out what to do every day is great for discipline, and reviewing the prep videos is always motivational. Also there is enough variety and intensity in it to keep it challenging - except I don't get the same variety with just home equipment. Next week we're told gyms open! I've also finished my first run thru the Core 4 Abs program and restarting it.\n\nAs part of getting my blood pressure under control the doc had me quit taking Naproxen. Consequently my joints ache all the time. Let's me know I'm still alive. New diet seems to be helping with weight, though, which is good.\n\n**Work / Financial**\n\nAbout a month ago just as the lockdown started I was transferred / matrixed to two women. I always ask \"what else do you need? What else should I be doing?\" etc. This week I find out one of them is complaining (not to me, of course) that I'm not doing what she wants. I contact her and ask her to tell me which team I should be working with, which of course she doesn't do. So now begins the recovery and \"alignment\" process. More importantly, trying to avoid being fired in this current work climate.\n\n**Mindset**\n\nThis work situation is not unusual. There's always some executive somewhere looking for a reason to be upset. The tension is the \"edge\" for consultants. You never want to be too comfortable, you'll miss something. Also you need to continually be ready that any given Friday they can say \"don't come back Monday\". Its happened before and it will happen again. Sort of like the Stoic practice of thinking through the pre-fail or worst outcome as a way to mentally ground yourself.\n\n**Relationship**\n\nThis part of my life is great. If I didn't know she had had a complete hysterectomy 25 years ago I'd say she must be ovulating. Extremely aggressive sexually. Sildenifil is my friend.",

Kids are 3 (girl) and 6 (boy).\n\nHome workout stats: Q&D protocol by Pavel Tsatsouline, usually with a 20kg kettlebell 3 times per week. This week was pussy week, however.\n\n**Readings:**\n\nSidebar books read: MMSLP, NMMNGx2, WISNIFG, RM, TWOTSM, MAP, Saving a low sex marriage, Bigger Leaner Stronger, Pook. \n\nBooks read that are not on the sidebar: Bigger Leaner Stronger, Leangains, Kettlebell Simple and Sinister, The Quick and the Dead\n\nNow reading: Fuccfiles, SGM\n\nReading queue: Day Bang, 48LOP\n\n**Shit to own**\n\n*Health:* In his books Pavel Tsatsouline calls the 48kg kettlebell The Beast. In keeping with the tradition, I will call the 12 kilo bell The Pussy. Long story short, I injured my back and switched to The Pussy for this weeks workouts. It happened after waiting in line for a long time with shitty posture reading SGM on my phone. Bad KB swing form could be a contributing factor, or it could be the extreme back flexion required until recently to put my daughter to bed. Constant 4-5 level pain in the very low back near the hips, on the right-hand side, with the occasional flashes of 8-9 when I tried to bend over or get up from bed. Lasted for 2 days and then subsided but did not completely go away. For two days, putting on socks or tying my shoes was a challenge. I pulled out Kettlebell Simple and Sinister, the chapter on hip hinge and proper form with the swing and did all the exercises with The Pussy two-handed. Yesterday did the same, with the 20kg kettlebell. Back felt fine. I decompress the spine by hanging from a bar at least once per day, I do hamstring stretches and try to avoid flexion of the spine as much as possible. I might even go to the doctor as an extreme measure, if all else fails. \n\nGyms will maybe open later this week. If so, I will do the first barbell workout this weekend and keep it light. \n\nKey takeaway: Im dealing with the back pain without being a miserable whining pussy, esp. with the wife.\n\n*Relationship (contains action item from last week):* So I play this game where I initiate at least two times per week and I win if my initiation was good according to me. Actually, its according to my dick  if it gets hard, the initiation was good. I continue to watch out for diminutive words and Im being successful like 80% of the time. \n\nBy above mentioned measure I did one low quality initiation and one high quality, both did not result in sex because the wife was tired or something. But the sexual pressure got to her so during the say she started giving me IOIs and coming to me for a kiss and an ass grab and eventually initiated sex herself. It was exactly like my standard Nice Guy initiations, only with the roles reversed: I asked her for a back rub because my back was sore, she gave me a good enough back rub and then started escalating with kisses all over my back and shoulders, getting naked and grinding her pussy on my ass and hips. I threw her down, ate her out, did a quick 69 where she licked my balls and then fucked missionary. Barely managed to last long enough and she came several seconds after me, which means I had to pump away with the post-cum erection. P.S. Sex makes the back pain worse. \n\nI had so much fun eliminating dimunitive words, I am going start another game  speak slowly, with a strong tone, eliminate verbal bullshit.\n\nKey takeaway #1: at some point I switched from seeking validation from my wife to seeking validation from random Internet faggots. Takeaway #2: I need to improve my Immersion first before focusing on the D, E, or V. Also, jerk off more often so that I can last longer.\n\n*Work (action item from last week):* this week my company returns to the office full time. I stay till late in the office and focus on clearing the to do list.\n\n*Kids:* I am doing a better job of setting boundaries before I lose my shit. I am also keeping cool when my wife loses her shit over the kids misbehaving. She has a much lower threshold than me.\n\nThe son wanted me to buy him a new game to play on his Android. Its a gigantic sum of money, around 10 euros. I wanted to buy it and use it as a reward for some desired behavior. I decided it should not be something he is supposed to be doing anyway, so I think I found the perfect solution: the son now has to demonstrate to me and the wife how he plays the free version of the game and stops playing when we tell him to stop. I told him  in order to buy you a good video game I want to see that you are able to control your addiction. We use the words phone sickness with him.\n\n*Thoughts on SGM:* the #1 thing Ill remember from SGM it the notion that women need sex more than men. It may or may not be true, but its a great frame to adopt when dealing with the wife, as in: I am giving her the gift of fucking.\n\n**Goals till May 19th  next week**\n\n New: Eliminate verbal bullshit, speak slowly and deliberately\n\n Get back to 15% BF or below <-- getting there\n\n Own the 20kg kettlebell  100 reps one-handed in 5 minutes <-- fuck, not gonna happen\n\n Keep initiating and DNGF <-- going OK so far\n\n start one of the game books (Day Bang?) and try out stuff on the wife <-- might have to postpone the deadline\n\n**Mission/ long-term stuff**\n\n Stop giving a fuck what others think, switch to internal validation\n\n Become a high energy charismatic guy. Prioritize my career and be successful in my current role, which is essentially running a business within the company\n\n Help my kids grow confident and strong, so that they make the big life decisions driven by ambition as opposed to driven by fear",

            "body": "###Marriage\n\nSTBX is having car issues. Keeps dying in random places because she hasn't gotten proper maintenance done on it.\n\nI need to reflect on why her negligence with her car maintenance makes me angry... it doesn't put the kids in danger really, just inconvenience and embarrass them and me (at least according to my feelings, and I don't want to make decisions based on that)\n\nAfter reflection I've come to the conclusion that (as usual for me) it stems from my lack of control of the situation. I can't force or coerse STBX to live her life better, and yet she still has an impact on my children in very real and tangible ways. She is their female role model, and I don't like what she models a lot of the time. \n\nThat said, I need to focus on my own shit before calling the kettle black. \n\nI made the appointment for the car and drove her to the bank to get her money. (Her car was fully nonfunctional at this point) Hopefully this puts an end to it IRL, but either way it was another opportunity for me to see inside myself and fix a fucked up thought/feeling.\n\n###Family\n\nSTFU continues to be a critical part of my life, for a Different reason than most guys here. As previously covered, I rent the second floor of my parent's large home. Large enough that the space over the garage is now STBX's \"apartment\" with me just using the kitchen and laundry, and the space over the rest of the house is \"my apartment\" where I spend the majority of my time when I'm actually home. \n\nMy parents obviously know that I'm out late several nights a week and for a chunk here and there on weekends, and while my step dad hasn't said anything, my mother has been probing and pressuring consistently. I've taken this as an important part of my growth program, because a large part of my BP conditioning and Nice Guy tendencies came from being raised by her in my early years as a single mother. Mostly I just STFU and ignore her, and I Fog outside of that. She's even gone overt once \"you're not working or running errands or working out this much, so why don't you take 3yo to play with your *friend's* kids? I'm sure they also have some???\" She's trying to Frame it as me missing time with my 3yo, but I'm doing this my way, and the stage of me being out until 9 almost every night will have been short lived. Like I said a few weeks ago, I always knew that my level of activity to create the plates I have now was not sustainable. Her feelings on this are not important. No one needs to know my inner thoughts, my plans, my weakness or my strength. No one. I am the judge of my own actions and I decide what I will do with my time. \n\nHad a \"critical moment\" with 3yo this week, from my perspective anyway. Critical more in my evaluation of my own efforts as a parent. Bedtime has been a sore point for me for a long time, and I haven't been consistent here like I have in many other areas of parenting for 3yo.\n\nShe had riled herself up to throwing a tantrum with mom, refusing to eat her dinner, despite STBX and my own attempts to de-escalate and distract her and get her to listen to us both. She was warned by both me and STBX many times that if she didn't stop, it would be early bed time with daddy. She kept going intentionally, gauging us both. So I took her to bed in my part of the house, spent about 15 minutes patiently but firmly leading her to calm down and stop the crying and screaming and such, then explaining what a consequence is and why she needs to listen to mom and dad, and staying firm through her varied techniques and attempts at getting me to cave and let her go back and finish eating her dinner in the noisy lit up part of the house. She finally fell asleep, and so did I, but even just a week or two ago I would have gotten frustrated that she always wants to be with mom where the screens are always on, and I would have taken her back to STBX and told her to deal with it. This time, while I am still unhappy with how STBX runs her end of bedtimes and continue to express this in the form of suggestions when 3yo is misbehaving, I didn't take my 3yo expressing this preference repeatedly as a personal offense and was amused by it instead - I had empathy for my 3yo and realized if I were in her shoes, I'd prefer mom too (little/no restrictions, stay up late every night, get away with a lot, tablet all the time to keep me out of mom's hair, etc) - but also I understand that as her father it is important for me to be consistent and follow through on things I tell her I am going to do, and teach her to live a life of integrity. I also want to model the type of man she should look for in her adult life, and a HVM doesn't let the mood swings of a toddler get the best of him \n\nI owned a little piece of my shit, and its a pretty important little nugget to me. I will stay consistent and build on this small victory.",

So dont be too surprised.\n\nAlso, why did you ask on that sub specifically? If you search for feminism in the searchbar, youll see more moderate and open subs before r/gendercritical (one of the first ones is r/askfeminists ffs, another, r/feminisms is also centered around debate, although not the kind you were looking for, but they wouldve probably taken your question a bit nicer anyway). Those have different policies on asking questions.\n\nAnd lastly, again: Why *that* sub? Why are you asking the radical part of a group to define the group for you? And lets not even get into the fact that this group is (to say it nicely) disliked by many other feminists for excluding trans people (thats who these feminists mean with the term terf).

I've come to a conclusion which ended up solving the main anxiety that I had for approaching.If a girl rejects me, it doesn't really phase me. I just laugh. This has always been the case for me. My biggest issue was with the judgments of those around because of my own life experiences. The reason is because I've lived with women my whole life, so I was left stuck in this weird place where I'd see the lack of calibration and empathy from pickup infields, and it made me really question my identity in pursuing pickup. I have no room to judge, but that's just how I genuinely feel about it. Even ToddV who seems like a cool dude and one of the better PUAs, when I've seen some of his older infields, the approaches were VERY persistent. Like it wasn't just a \"shit test\", the girl was straight up like \"fuck off\" and he's trying to frame it like she's playing hard to get. Even if she was, why would you want to be around someone like that? The chick clearly has issues.\n\nIt's so evident to me because I'm so used to being around women throughout my life. Even back in high school, I was so used to being around women that I'd be flirting with tons of chicks while thinking that we were just being friendly the whole time. Then I'd have all these chicks into me without knowing how to escalate. The issue is that because I had that perspective, it made things 10x harder since any time I took a risk, it would be a reminder of my experience with sisters and I would project how it would be like if someone approached my sisters in that way. Like if my sister was walking in the street and some dude saw her, then ran back all the way just to do a calculated stance in front of her to pick up her up in middle of the street, I would view the dude as a bit weird ngl. And I know that she would too. This isn't one of those \"don't listen to what girls say, see what they do\".  This isn't my sisters who'd tell me this. This me seeing how they and other girls react to it. And it's even obvious in the infield. The girl has uncomfortable af body language, and usually the ones who go with these types of approaches tend to be bar chicks or very insecure and don't socially \"get it\".  I've realized that both guys and girls have this, but we have different levels of social awareness. You could pull 1/10 of the chicks you approach, but you're pulling in the same way you're approaching based on what they're willing to accept based on your emotional understanding of the world. There's so much more going on behind the scenes. You can still find success in it if you're looking for a lay with anyone, but you're literally being a gremlin to everyone around and not considering their needs. Like for me personally, it's straight up lacking in compassion.\n\nThe only times that it works with an actually cool chick is when the approach is genuine. Like you actually give a fuck about who they are. Maybe not in a club, but how many of those chicks respect themselves? Not many, from what I've seen. I've been approached by chicks before where they approached in a smooth way and I was into it. They didn't say \"excuse me real quick, i think you're cute and yada yada yada\". They would do a cold-read, qualify and gage a bit while having casual body language, then maybe throw in some teasing or flirting or whatever else throughout the interaction. The push-pull happened naturally from them being honest about their likes and dislikes. And they knew how to relate the conversation to the situation at hand. It's so natural and they don't even feel like strangers anymore. And when I say genuine, I don't mean the \"genuine\" that is thrown around with no actual context, but I mean like \"this is me, love it or hate it, who are you, are you in and are you worth it?\". \n\nNow if it was someone in a coffee shop or at a bus stop, where you go in indirectly (and slowly build up to direct within the same interaction by creating premise) while building some rapport, then leading into teasing then that's a whole other story. Even the best salesmen do this. They build some rapport first and then they go for the sale. Sure, you need to make the chick nervous, but it's the nervousness that comes with a new interaction. Just good body language and eye contact creates sexual tension. That seems like normal game. Like I've only done a few cold approaches, but there's a reason for it. Internally, I wasn't able to morally justify it. Going up and running after a chick to say a direct approach when I don't know them is uncalibrated. You can frame it how you want about the \"lucky one who wants a compliment\", but you're basically a salesmen who's chasing people around, rather than being calibrated about it. Just throwing negs and shit and all this other weird pua bs outside of what's taught in \"models\" seems like the guide for someone who's never been around women or doesn't have that empathy perspective or social awareness. It confuses me when I see people on here who aren't aware of it. I'm not trying to make the awareness of it seem special, but it's so CLEAR that it confuses me when the people I see doing PUA don't notice it. \n\nI know I went hard with all that I wrote, but regardless, I'll admit that I can't come to any conclusion until I actually do at least 100-200 cold approaches. And since I don't have asbergers, I trust that I'll be able to learn from mistakes rather than just repeat them and blame everyone else but myself. But, I'm not going to chase after a girl on the street. I'm either going to approach a chick who's stopped, or walking past me (but not chase after them). If a girl has a boyfriend, I'm also not going to pursue them (except I might try to continue the convo because I'm interested in the person's perspective or life experiences). That way, morally, I can be okay with myself and know that even if others judge me or I get blasted in public, I know that I'm a compassionate person and that's all that matters. This is what stopped me from approaching before. Others' judgments were a reflection on my own lack of respect for myself in doing the typical type of cold approach.\n\nTL;DR I realized that I had to try it out before coming to any conclusions. On the other hand, I STILL think that genuine approach is king. But indirect leading into direct within the same first interaction. Not lying, but being aware of the surroundings since they don't know me. And approaching in a way that I can be proud of. Because if I'm not proud of it, others' judgments will always affect me. Then, if I get blown out, or people judge me hard, idgaf because I know that I was being considerate and at that point it's their issue. If anything, I'm living rent-free in their head.",

            "body": "My biggest fear of cold approach wasn't rejection, it was about the judgments of everyone else because it made me question my own value system and identity. I've come to a conclusion which ended up solving the main anxiety that I had for approaching.If a girl rejects me, it doesn't really phase me. I just laugh. This has always been the case for me. My biggest issue was with the judgments of those around because of my own life experiences. The reason is because I've lived with women my whole life, so I was left stuck in this weird place where I'd see the lack of calibration and empathy from pickup infields, and it made me really question my identity in pursuing pickup. I have no room to judge, but that's just how I genuinely feel about it. Even ToddV who seems like a cool dude and one of the better PUAs, when I've seen some of his older infields, the approaches were VERY persistent. Like it wasn't just a \"shit test\", the girl was straight up like \"fuck off\" and he's trying to frame it like she's playing hard to get. Even if she was, why would you want to be around someone like that? The chick clearly has issues.\n\nIt's so evident to me because I'm so used to being around women throughout my life. Even back in high school, I was so used to being around women that I'd be flirting with tons of chicks while thinking that we were just being friendly the whole time. Then I'd have all these chicks into me without knowing how to escalate. The issue is that because I had that perspective, it made things 10x harder since any time I took a risk, it would be a reminder of my experience with sisters and I would project how it would be like if someone approached my sisters in that way. Like if my sister was walking in the street and some dude saw her, then ran back all the way just to do a calculated stance in front of her to pick up her up in middle of the street, I would view the dude as a bit weird ngl. And I know that she would too. This isn't one of those \"don't listen to what girls say, see what they do\".  This isn't my sisters who'd tell me this. This me seeing how they and other girls react to it. And it's even obvious in the infield. The girl has uncomfortable af body language, and usually the ones who go with these types of approaches tend to be bar chicks or very insecure and don't socially \"get it\".  I've realized that both guys and girls have this, but we have different levels of social awareness. You could pull 1/10 of the chicks you approach, but you're pulling in the same way you're approaching based on what they're willing to accept based on your emotional understanding of the world. There's so much more going on behind the scenes. You can still find success in it if you're looking for a lay with anyone, but you're literally being a gremlin to everyone around and not considering their needs. Like for me personally, it's straight up lacking in compassion.\n\nThe only times that it works with an actually cool chick is when the approach is genuine. Like you actually give a fuck about who they are. Maybe not in a club, but how many of those chicks respect themselves? Not many, from what I've seen. I've been approached by chicks before where they approached in a smooth way and I was into it. They didn't say \"excuse me real quick, i think you're cute and yada yada yada\". They would do a cold-read, qualify and gage a bit while having casual body language, then maybe throw in some teasing or flirting or whatever else throughout the interaction. The push-pull happened naturally from them being honest about their likes and dislikes. And they knew how to relate the conversation to the situation at hand. It's so natural and they don't even feel like strangers anymore. And when I say genuine, I don't mean the \"genuine\" that is thrown around with no actual context, but I mean like \"this is me, love it or hate it, who are you, are you in and are you worth it?\". \n\nNow if it was someone in a coffee shop or at a bus stop, where you go in indirectly (and slowly build up to direct within the same interaction by creating premise) while building some rapport, then leading into teasing then that's a whole other story. Even the best salesmen do this. They build some rapport first and then they go for the sale. Sure, you need to make the chick nervous, but it's the nervousness that comes with a new interaction. Just good body language and eye contact creates sexual tension. That seems like normal game. Like I've only done a few cold approaches, but there's a reason for it. Internally, I wasn't able to morally justify it. Going up and running after a chick to say a direct approach when I don't know them is uncalibrated. You can frame it how you want about the \"lucky one who wants a compliment\", but you're basically a salesmen who's chasing people around, rather than being calibrated about it. Just throwing negs and shit and all this other weird pua bs outside of what's taught in \"models\" seems like the guide for someone who's never been around women or doesn't have that empathy perspective or social awareness. It confuses me when I see people on here who aren't aware of it. I'm not trying to make the awareness of it seem special, but it's so CLEAR that it confuses me when the people I see doing PUA don't notice it. \n\nI know I went hard with all that I wrote, but regardless, I'll admit that I can't come to any conclusion until I actually do at least 100-200 cold approaches. And since I don't have asbergers, I trust that I'll be able to learn from mistakes rather than just repeat them and blame everyone else but myself. But, I'm not going to chase after a girl on the street. I'm either going to approach a chick who's stopped, or walking past me (but not chase after them). If a girl has a boyfriend, I'm also not going to pursue them (except I might try to continue the convo because I'm interested in the person's perspective or life experiences). That way, morally, I can be okay with myself and know that even if others judge me or I get blasted in public, I know that I'm a compassionate person and that's all that matters. This is what stopped me from approaching before. Others' judgments were a reflection on my own lack of respect for myself in doing the typical type of cold approach.\n\nTL;DR I realized that I had to try it out before coming to any conclusions. On the other hand, I STILL think that genuine approach is king. But indirect leading into direct within the same first interaction. Not lying, but being aware of the surroundings since they don't know me. And approaching in a way that I can be proud of. Because if I'm not proud of it, others' judgments will always affect me. Then, if I get blown out, or people judge me hard, idgaf because I know that I was being considerate and at that point it's their issue. If anything, I'm living rent-free in their head.",

I walk up to her and say, excuse me! I introduce myself to her. She does the same to me. I tell her that I think she is a very attractive woman as well as that I would like to get to know her.

I say thats okay and that Id love to be her friend, so I ask her for her number.\n\nQue the boyfriend pulling up on a motorcycle and revving his engine for her to get on. She tells me thats him and I shake her hand as well as tell her it was nice to meet her and I walk away. About 3-5 minutes later I see the motorcycle drive off and same girl with other people hugging someone which appeared to be a friend, so I walk over to her and asked if she was just dumped to which she replies that shes just meeting him somewhere else. Looking back on that second encounter I feel stupid because I couldve said looks like I have a chance to get that number after all or something like that. Is there any other way I could have handled the second encounter?\n\n2.) There was this other attractive brunette girl that kept exchanging looks with me, but I was too enveloped in a conversation with the group that I was interjecting myself in to go over there. Looking back I should have totally went over there for at least a moment. I was actually about to invite that girl into the group and she walked to the parking lot.

They will only give signs they *don't want* physical moves. If you are close to her and she leans back, she's not ready yet. If she doesn't, you can move to the next step. If she has some kind of accessories on her wrists or fingers, lightly touch her hand/wrist and ask about them. She'll probably be okay with that, so move to the next step. Lightly brush her hair and compliment her on it. If she doesn't move her head back, you can continue moving up. If she does give a *no* signal, go back one or two steps, then work your way from there again. That's basically how it goes.\n\nNow what helps me easing into getting more touchy is creating excuses. If she's wearing heels, take her down a route with some stairs, and lock your arm into hers for \"support\". Go roller skating and take her hand. Teach her how to shoot pool or throw darts--anything that involves touching and moving parts of her body, under the guise that it's not *only* sexual touching.

She isn't interested romantically which she mentioned. So then you turn and say as friend 1) that looks needy. 2) no one ever would believe that after that point even if you changed your mind. She would always question your intentions hence she plain rejected that option too. Then finally somehow she gave ig which is low risk. She can block him if she wants to.

Smiling gives her the idea that you are living your own life, you seem to be having fun doing it, and maybe she would like to be a part of the fun. \nGirls want to feel alive and guys with a scowl on their face will likely never even be given the opportunity to talk to her to begin with. No one wants to be around someone that looks bored to death. \nSometimes we may come across as serious or intense by getting caught up in our own thoughts by thinking of what to say next, or overanalyzing a past approach. Being caught up in our own thoughts keeps us from living in the moment and enjoying the things around us RIGHT NOW. \nYou dont need to be happy to smile, but you need to smile to be happy. Next time you make eye contact with a girl, dont think, just smile. It will make all the difference.",

            "body": "My improved posture has completely changed how men and women treat me in one dayI recently wanted to stop talking to women to focus on improving myself, and to detox, and very quickly, one of my self improvements was chest up, chin up and shoulders back. The look straighten my body from head to toe, and gave my vibe/look like one of those super confident attractive guys look that you rarely see. I have to admit, the results have been life changing.\n\nThis all happened last 48 hours\n\nFirst off, a lot of women stare, and for much longer. The first women was on a date with a guy at a bar, and in-between small talk with the guy  I had to go to the bathroom. Well, there are mirrors that I can see him and his date as I walk away either direction, and all I saw was this guy's date have the most memorizing stare I've seen on a girl. Right in front of him. Nothing held back. Beautiful girl btw, but I'm not a terrible person, so I would never encourage guy hopping while on a date. The look gave that \"this guy is so interesting\". They haven't been dating long it turns out.\n\nOn the same night, a more heavy set girl and her friend stand behind me at the bar. I look behind me, and I see two genuinely nice smiles. I'm not into bigger women, personally, but I still found it really nice.\n\nNext day at work, a female customer did a tripple take at me. One coworker checked me out from head to toe with a smile, and a 2nd coworker is straight up looking to rebound her break up by putting a lot of really cute effort into being close to me, and having me notice her. She does these really attractive/confident stare with a smile. Did a little small talk, but the sexual tension was so intense. I might actually be down for what she's looking for. I actually really liked her sway when she  walked passed me for no reason and then looked back at me to see if I noticed her. Her flirt was up to 11.\n\n last night, at the bars and club, another heavy girl flat out put my friend down because she thought he was ugly and I was attractive, and said she was down to fuck. That one pissed me off. So I shut her down by letting her know she's shitty. I leave to a new bar, and IMMEDIATELY, a wicked cutie hits on me which I assume is a one nighter she's looking for. I fucked that one up because I was so caught off guard, and ended up saying things that sounded like I was rejecting her. (Oops). I wasn't thinking before I spoke, so I ended up saying things that made her feel hurt.\n\nFinally, my male friend straight up told me I was clearly a really good looking guy. This one felt so nice, because he's a really good dude, and straight men don't normally tell me that. (Bless you)\n\nThe rate of attention I got wasn't anywhere close to this before I decided to actually look confident. I also feel more powerful. I'm 6'4, and now look properly strong. Mentally and physically, girls and guy notice my vibe, and want to be around it.\n\nSo now it's day three, and about to go to work. And make the bar after. Based on all the attention with my new posture, I look forward to how people will treat me.\n\nUpdate: at the bar right now. Haven't been looking around much, but have caught two 8s stealing glaces. One of them double takes and held the stare for a long time. Not sure how else to explain this shit.",

While I think having a partner is important to being happy & full-filled it's not the only important relationship.\n\nA solid relationship with family, high quality friends, and even a strong relationship with yourself are extremely important. The dynamics I've create in each of these have been the backbone to my success. Having people I can count on, people I can learn from and people who raise me up.\n\n:\n\nIt took me longer than I'd like to admit to handle this area of my life. I was perfectly content just coasting by with little effort for a few too many years but I decided at some point that I wanted more from myself. My parents didn't work as hard as they did for me to make an average income. Being financially free has allowed me to not only re invest into myself and my business, but also eat where I want, stay where I want, travel where I want and buy what I want. Life isn't only about working hard but also enjoying the fruits of your efforts.\n\n:\n\nSplit into 3 parts:\n\nGarbage in = garbage out. I used to love shake shack. If I could have it more than once a week, it would be a no brainer. Problem is I was always tired, slow and lethargic. I would need naps just to get through a day. As soon as I started to care a little more as to what I put in, I had more energy than ever before, and I stopped getting sick. Now? I can't even stomach a shake shack burger even if I tried!\n\nWorking out and getting in shape. While I'm no bodybuilder, I'm always working to improve my body and take care of myself physically. If I look good, I feel good.\n\nRest.\n\nFor some reason we've all been sold on the \"KEEP GOING TILL YOU DIE\" mentality. We forget how important rest is for the body, for the mind, for ourselves in general. If you don't take some time to rest your body will force you to do so. (I was so overworked last year that I collapsed in an elevator and smashed my head due to this 'keep going no rest' mentality, wasn't fun)\n\n:\nEducating yourself on a continuous basis. Reading books, meditating, learning how to be in control of your emotions when need be (not over reacting) but also being able to express them and experience them when need be. Your mind is capable of more than you give it credit for. If you take care of it, it will take care of you.\n\n      :\n\nBeing able to drop your ego and being able to say \"I don't know how to do this, maybe someone can help?\"\n\nFor a large majority of my life, I held myself back because I was too proud to ask for help. I kept telling myself that I'll figure it out somehow. With that attitude my progress came to a stand still. For years I was lying to myself, till I finally said ok maybe I can use some help. As soon as I did that, every area above accelerated. I had momentum and success in more areas than one and I was able to achieve things I previously could only dream of. Sure I had to invest money to do so, but the trade off vs the results I achieved was a no brainer.\n\nThere are people out there willing to help you, you just need to reach out and ask.\n\nHope this helps\n\n- S\n\n\n(P.S I'm run an awesome facebook group, feel free to join, ask questions or even give value to the other members https://www.facebook.com/groups/moaforum )",

Master eye contact and you'll notice you're having more and more success with women.\n\nGreetings are very natural and gives off a warm vibe.  Don't try to sound sexy or cool.

Especially if you see the person frequently.\n\nSmall talk is when you can throw in your wittiness.\n\nHer: \"Every time I see you you're drinking coffee\"\n\nYou: \"So how long have you had your eye on me?\" said with a smile.\n\nDon't expect fireworks, just observe her reaction.\n\nFarewells don't require a hug or a kiss.  I know \"kiss closing\" is your goal, but you could kiss somebody today and she could be kissing someone new tomorrow.  It's not an accomplishment.  If you want to speak to her again, just get her social media info or phone number.  With social media, you can see what kind of person she is a little more.

All went sour because I was too needy.   \nThanks everyone on this sub.  \n\n\nThe push and pull technique really worked! And for me, it's the best method to get women.  \nWomen are more driven by emotion than logic. They get \"aroused\" when they get  curious about you.  \nI gave her different signals. I am not predictable. I made sure she is always confused.  \n\n\nI stopped obsessing about her. Before, I was checking her online status and social medias 24/7.  \nI went out to play soccer/football, get a job, kept myself busy and play video games to stop being needy all the time. I realized I was talking and chatting her through the phone all day.\n\nWhen I read about this sub, I immidietly stopped that hobby. \n\nShe got attached to me because we were constantly chatting, so I decided to \"push\" her away by not replying her messages instantly. Declined her coffee and pizza invitations. Declined to play video games with her. I didn't make myself available all the time. Now she is thinking about me. \n\nThen I make my self available and chat to her always, then again go cold for a while - repeat. Making her really confused. \"Does he like me or not?\"\n\n\nThis created more attraction.   \nBut it's really hard to control yourself. I just made myself busy to stop being needy.\n \nNever confess your feelings to your crush. Why? Because she gets bored, she is no longer curious because she already got the answer.\nWhen women fall in love to you, they become \"obssesed\". They no longer give a shit to your wealth and physical appearance.",

            "body": "How I succeeded in datingAfter reading a lot of hoopla on inner game, flirting and other BS that there is out there, I came to an undeniable conclusion that most of these were full of shit. Sure, you could learn something of value from there, but most of it BS. So, I started using my common sense and got success.\n\nI started working out. Not just because I wanted to date hot girls, but because I wanted to improve my health. This after having a fatal hospitalisation due to liver swelling. I improved my diet, which was now balanced and vegetarian. I did eat boiled eggs for breakfast though. And, I started working out. Hired a trainer and started finally. There were many points in time where I simply wanted to run away from gym and sleep in my cozy bed. It was painful, but worth it in the end. Now, for a year I have not been sick. Not even a cold.\n\nSecondly, I started visiting a good barber. I can't emphasise how important is having a good hair cut. After getting my haircut, I kept going to the same since it is important to go to the same barber for maintaining a good hairstyle. I have specs so I bought a stylish pair of eyewear.\n\nThirdly, I improved my fashion sense. I started taking my female friends for shopping my clothes. If you want to attract females, better ask them what suits you. Besides, they have a much better fashion sense than males.\n\nMeanwhile, while executing all this, I started socialising. Like just going out there. Started chatting up any girls that I liked. Initially, I had nerves. I was frantic, nervous. But gradually I started gaining confidence. I read somewhere that when girls reject you, think of it as their loss instead of yours. Initially, I will be honest, I got depressed upon rejection. It shattered my confidence, but I kept at it. I had to. And eventually, this benefited me. I became desensitised to rejection. Whenever I got rejected, I got a bit sad but moved on. \n\nThen after some time, I finally got success. Hence my confidence increased. But a big part of it was me getting fit. I cannot emphasise the importance of what being fit did to my confidence. No longer had a pot belly. No longer was I skinny. So I would say this, going to gym and being fit will boost your confidence enormously. You do not need to Arnold Schwarzenegger. Just be fit. Muscular. Don't go overboard with it, lol.\n\nAnother thing that has kept me happy in the relationships is:-\n\n* I do not dip my pen in crazy ink.\n* No games. No push pull. Be genuinely busy. Develop constructive hobbies. Develop interests. Be an interesting person for the sake of living fullfiling life. Not to get chicks.\n* Never pursued a girl that was playing games. I have my self respect intact. No girl is worth losing it. I have a rule about dating. If after first date, the girl does not herself ask for another date or start a conversation, I consider it to be the end of it. Never drive single handedly. After some time if a girl is not reciprocating, or is confused. I tell them to make up their mind.\n* Be forth coming once you start dating about what you want. No pussyfooting about what you want. Do not be friends if you are attracted. You will end up suffering.\n* Do not be manipulative. Do not put a nice guy act. Girls can see through it within seconds. They might end up using you and then dumping you before you get anything.\n* Do not stalk. Do not be pathetic. No means no. Develop a thick skin and learn to move on.\n\n\ntldr:- Use your common sense. You do not need a love guru or a dating guide or any other BS.",

It's easy to read everything on here, buy seduction books/courses, read 100 websites, watch other people hit on girls, feeling that rush of dopamine as you excitedly think, \"It's not that hard - I could do it too!\" But it's another thing to actually *do it yourself*. **Taking that first step is the hardest step you'll ever take.**\n\nOther guys feel like it's too late for them, or that they're \"far too fucked-up\" to ever have any hope of getting laid or finding a girlfriend or being in a happy relationship. They'll lurk on here (maybe even comment every now and then), reading everything that's posted, but they'll never in a billion years even consider for a second that they could be out there making progress themselves. They gave up hope years ago; after all, getting laid is something that's reserved for *other people*.\n\nI want to share my story, to show you no matter how much of a handicap you're starting with, no matter how screwed up your life or your mindset or your head may be - you can turn it all around. It won't be easy. It'll take a shitload of work - probably years. But it's very bloody doable.\n\n**I'll give the short version of my story:**\n\nI was extremely suicidal from age 14 to 23. As in, every single day Id have fantasies of killing myself. I lost count of the number of times I found myself in the kitchen holding a knife to my wrist, willing myself to have the courage to *finally fucking do it*.\n\nI was in 2 abusive relationships, had ZERO friends, and my life consisted of nothing that really made me happy. I didn't think any women would ever truly like me (my girlfriend at the time hated me, it was a pretty fucked up relationship - we just yelled and screamed at each other all the time). I had a job for a bit but I lost it, and that was when things *really* got bad.\n\nThat job was really the only thing getting me out of the house, and once I no longer had it, I turned to alcohol. I became a raging alcoholic (was drunk basically 24/7), developed a severe porn addiction  (most days watching 8hrs of porn) and spent the rest of the time playing video games. I developed really bad agoraphobia (fear of leaving the house) - I literally couldn't go outside to check the mail. I'd make excuses not to even go to the grocery store - I'd make my girlfriend buy all our groceries, which only made her hate me more.\n\nI hated my life, and I hated *myself* even more. I had no friends, no confidence, no reason for existing, nothing that made me smile. My family lived 5000km away so I didn't even have them. I was obviously depressed as hell about it all - like I said, I used to fantasise about the knives in the kitchen draw, or I'd be crossing the road and I'd see a truck coming and I'd think, \"If I just closed my eyes and stood here right now, it could all be over.\"\n\nWorst of all I was completely hopeless - I was convinced there was **no way** I could ever change. I was stuck in this miserable existence and I'd always be unhappy. I told myself when I hit my 30th birthday, I was allowed to kill myself.\n\nEventually I hit rock bottom when my girlfriend broke up with me, and my family found out how depressed/suicidal I'd been. I had to confess everything - the addictions, the alcoholism, the agoraphobia, the suicidal thoughts, how much I hated living.\n\nMy parents were so fucking supportive - I moved back home to live with them for a year. They forced me to go see a counsellor, and forced me to start leaving the house. It was absolute *hell* at first, but I slowly got better at just being outside, then making friends, then working on my addictions. I lost weight (75lbs in total), started hitting the gym and lifting weights (went from not being able to do a single pushup/pullup/squat, to being able to deadlift 175kg). I found self-improvement websites and started getting my mind right, worked on actually *liking* myself, and started building a life I could be proud of.\n\nThe last thing I had to fix was my dating life - and that was honestly the hardest thing ever. I went through an \"approach anxiety program\" (google \"Good Looking Loser Approach Anxiety Program\" - it's free) and that was absolute HELL. You end up talking to 1500+ girls over the 6 weeks. But, by the end of it, I was confident enough to actually hit on girls properly and try to have sex with them (even though I was still terrified and shaking most of the time), and I actually started getting laid. I went on OkCupid/POF/Tinder/etc as well, and over time got really good at getting laid on there too.\n\nI've met some fucking *amazing* women over the years since then, including my current girlfriend of 2 years. She's the sweetest, coolest girl I've met - she adds a *hell* of a lot to my life. She's also bisexual so we've had a bunch of 3somes with other girls (about 12 from memory). Good fun.\n\nI never in a billion years thought I'd actually have any women truly *like* me for who I am - let alone have sex with me - let alone have 3somes and wild sex adventures a girlfriend who adores me. That stuff seemed so impossibly out-of-reach for me all those years ago; like a pipe dream I dare not even contemplate.\n\nMost importantly of all, I'm really fucking **happy** with my life. I haven't had a suicidal thought in years, I haven't been depressed in years - every fucking day feels like I've been given a gift and I'm so bloody grateful for it.\n\nI cover the rest of my transformation story here: [My Transformation.](https://killyourinnerloser.com/my-transformation/)\n\nSome before/after pics:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/703e7sv0yix41.jpg?width=922&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1e5602edcce4e5da6a29201e27ea041e896eb62b\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/i0gr2os1yix41.jpg?width=800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=379b29502e1eeded6075fdd891fff3455f419037\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pfctrhf2yix41.jpg?width=800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9948c746287d4dc09a2549c815f9c4733fdcb36d\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/txdrmhb3yix41.jpg?width=858&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f6c68797a0a3a4e8ad22e4b1eb6af1329ca02c13\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd [proof I get laid now](https://killyourinnerloser.com/proof/) (including pics/vids/stories).\n\nI hate the idea that anyone is sitting on here thinking they're a *lost cause*, that it's too late for them, that they're too far gone, that they'll never be able to change. I hate the idea anyone feels like their struggles are insurmountable. Trust me when I say this: **I am nothing special**.\n\nIt doesn't take willpower (in fact, I have [very little discipline or willpower](https://killyourinnerloser.com/andy-discipline-willpower)). You just have to start working on your goals a little at a time - aim to just take *one tiny little baby step forward* every single day. Those tiny little steps add up over time, and before you know it, you'll be a long way ahead of where you started.\n\nIf you're unhappy with your appearance - start losing fat/hit the gym. All you have to do is sign up for a gym membership, or go Google \"how to lose weight\". **That's one baby step you can take right now.**\n\nIf you don't know how to talk to girls, go google \"Good Looking Loser Approach Anxiety Program\". Just google it and read a bit of it. **That's one baby step you can take right now.**\n\nIf you have no idea where to meet women, sign up for Tinder and just start talking to girls. I have a huge (free) Tinder guide on my site that covers literally every step from improving your looks, to taking pics, to messaging girls, going on dates, having sex, and even keeping them around for months/years afterwards. Seriously, just install Tinder and just start getting used to how the app works (you don't even have to message any girls yet) - **that's one baby step you can take right now.**\n\nIf you're super depressed, google counsellors in your area. Or send a message to a mate, \"Hey man I gotta be honest, I've been feeling really bad lately.\" Or send a text to a family member telling them you've been feeling down for a while. **That's one baby step you can take right now.**\n\nNo matter where you're at right now, there is always *something* you can do. Some tiny little baby step you can take **right now**\\*.\\* Stop reading, stop sitting around watching other people find success, and stop thinking you aren't worthy.\n\nIf I can do it, **you sure as hell can too.**\n\n\\-Andy",

I know and read the most popular material (models etc.).\n\nAnd once in a while I stumble on a detail about game that I haven't figured out.\n\nIn my first year I went by the 'hell yes hell no principle'. Thinking that if women flaked or did any sign of disinterest I moved on.\n\nBut now I have more experience I start to notice that it isn't this straight forward at all. I had a date for example where the girl wanted to leave. I turned it around and had a f close. Same with reinitiating  contact. Girl doesn't answer texts says she is busy but 2 months later we still hook up.\n\nI was far too negative. Having a short fuse to think women aren't into me by the first sign of trouble.\n\nOfcourse if a girl is bothering me with her behavior I let it go. But if I am less insecure about it I just try again and to my suprise I often get what I want.\n\nSo I am thinking about the double text.\n\nWe are having a fun conversation. About equal investment.

(Shocker, I know.) I dont typically entertain girls who send one word replies, and then leave me on read after a while, in fact, Im usually the one who leaves the girl on read at this point, but if she is generally engaging, might be worth playing the long game. The best advice I can give though, dont double text on the same day, thats a mistake I made for a long time, and it was impulsive.

I lacked confidence almost my entire life, I was not awkward but I still felt like I needed more confidence. One thing that helped me gain A LOT of confidence is this:\nOne night I was extremely bored and thought I might download Tinder, so I did that and I upgraded to gold version. I changed my locations often to many different countries, I also downloaded some apps where you can talk to strangers online. I downloaded an app where you connect with snapchat and you can match with girls and talk to snapchat.\nHow did this help me?\nWell I got some matches and started chatting with some girls from Poland, Germany, Indonesia, Brazil, anyway the countries doesnt matter. I felt an immediate ego boost, to see that women from all around the world would want to talk to me. What matters is this, you are attractive, some girls will find you attractive, some wont. What you need to remember is that you are attractive! Anyways when I did this I noticed that I was talking to 10 or more girls that I probably wont ever meet in real life. I wasnt worried that I might say something wrong to drive them away from me, because they are so far away from me that I wont see them in real life. I just had fun and had interesting conversations. The thing is when I started talking to girls with whom I could actually meet up with I wasnt asking myself questions like Did I text her early, did I text her late, did I say something wrong? I just went with the flow and talked to them, I KNEW that I was attractive, I knew that women wanted to have conversations with me. What I got from my experience is that some women will like you and some wont and guess what, thats fine!! If you keep doing this, talking to girls from all around the world, I promise you will improve your confidence and conversation skills!\n\nSo to summarize: download many online chatting and dating apps, meet women from all around the world, talk to them, you will see that when you talk to women from far away and when you talk to those women that you can actually meet up that there isnt a difference, you will gain confidence, you will improve your conversation skills, you will improve your text game!\n\nAnyways just wanted to share what helped me, if you want to know which apps I used just PM me and I will tell you! Remember guys, you are attractive!!",

I am here to show you how wrong this is. Coming from an ex-communist country, my propaganda detector is well honed. The Propaganda machine in the West is far more insidious than that of a \"totalitarian\" nation. While a \"totalitarian\" nation may blatantly repress dissenting speech and thus make the dissenters look like martyrs, the West - under the guise of free and fair press and under the guise of democracy can shape and influence public opinion and few will be the wiser as there is no blatant repression of speech and thus no obvious tyranny to resist. Furthermore, repressing overt nationalism further aids the propaganda machine, as any anti-country news will be viewed as \"objective\" because it is not overtly nationalistic. But ironically this conception plays into peoples need to identify with a tribe, and people do so subconciously while being able to feel good about themselves that they are non-nationalistic and a fighter for \"democracy\" and \"freedom\".\n\nWhy do I write this? Today I have received a blatant anti-chinese propaganda newspaper on my doorstep, from a previously unknown newspaper that is encouraged by the municipal government.\n\nSince we on the redpill are concerned with truth, we should not only be seeking truth in terms of women, but also truths of the world and how the powers that be are attempting to influence our perceptions indirectly. As an unassimilated immigrant it is much easier to see and fight back against attempted mind control, not only because I have seen this in my own country but because I am already distrustful of the culture as a whole.\n\nAttached I present you the first page of this propaganda piece. Not only does the paper present an anti-china stance, it is also an expos on how language is on how language is manipulated to influence thought, through phrases like \"70 years of BRUTAL dictatorship\" and other similar statements. This language is very similar to what we see used internally against men, right wingers or those the leftist media deems a persona non grata.\n\nIt almost feels like we are on war footing, with the level of anti-chinese propaganda occuring and it progressively ramping up. It seems to me that the Western governments do not want this crises to go to waste and are looking to bring down the greatest threat to the Western rule since the fall of the USSR if not since ever.\n\nChina is poised on the brink of becoming the new world leader and to wrest control of the world from the United States - if it weathers this storm, I think it will become unstoppable manipulated to influence thought, through phrases like \"70 years of BRUTAL dictatorship\" and other similar statements. This language is very similar to what we see used internally against men, right wingers or those the leftist media deems a persona non grata.\n\nIt almost feels like we are on war footing, with the level of anti-Chinese propaganda occurring and it progressively ramping up.

This is why the Soviet propaganda machine was inferior to that of the US, it operated on absolutes rather than insinuations (at least internally - it was much more effective externally). I recognize this method of propaganda, because this is how the KGB ran its own Propaganda campaigns in Western countries, creating fake papers and journal articles to influence western governments to believe in the possibility of nuclear winter and thus make the idea of nuclear disarmament more plausible.\n\nI write this as a warning to all of you living your daily lives, just as you are wary of women and the bluepill regarding them, be aware that much of the same techniques are used to control and influence your thoughts regarding the political situation in the country. Also, think whether this control is actually in your benefit, because if it was, would there be a need for propaganda campaigns?",

As I said, I am european and I do not know why you bought the USA drobe, NSA, gov stuff on table. This subject outclasses me.

If it is as you say, would you also add the argument that Germany under A.H. was an economical power also?\n\njust because there is poverty in some places in china does not at all take away from its economic achievements. it has singlehandledy raised hundreds of millions out of poverty and continue to raise millions more every year.\n\nAnd yes, germany was an economic miracle under AH\n\n>Ok, I see why you bought women into discussion, you made a point. Well, communism exists in countries like Cuba, China, N Koreea, Vietnam, not sure about Venez and all of them are crap holes, except China that is doing better because they liberalised their economy. That's not an argument why commie is good and it works.\n\ncapitalism exists in many places of the world - brazil, belize, cote d'ivore, democratic republic of congo, etc and they are all doing poorly economically - does that mean that capitalism is a failure?\n\n\n>can you provide me the links that state your theory that US soldiers planted the virus in Wuhan?
